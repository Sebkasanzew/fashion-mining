After going to Pushkin Palace, the boys decided to throw a little indoor goo<span class="brand" style="color: red">db</span>ye party for me at the hotel. We went to a real <span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>ian market, bought some food, some caviar (US$30 for 1 kilogram), then to a supermarket to buy some booze, then called a special "someone" to get some "stuff"&#8230; if you know what I mean. ;)
As soon as we got into my room, bam!!! Fun, fun, fun!. I had 2 of the boys try on some my stuff cause they all looked like gansgters in black. LOL. I asked Poletay (see below) to try my <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dior</span> boots on and another guy to try my fox jacket and pose like a pimp.

New <span class="brand" style="color: red">York</span> fashion week is always a great idea! So many beautiful clothes to see in such a short period of time. Hood By Air, Tim <span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>ppens, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Alexand<span class="brand" style="color: red">er</span> Wang</span>, and Rochambeau were few of the many shows I attended. &#160;It's always hard to save battery on your phone when you're trying to take as many pictures as possible. Enjoy :)

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Alexand<span class="brand" style="color: red">er</span> Wang</span>'s collaboration with <span class="brand" style="color: red">H&amp;M</span> has by far set the standard for any collaboration with <span class="brand" style="color: red">H&amp;M</span>. &#160;With collabs such as <span class="brand" style="color: red">Versace<span class="brand" style="color: red"></spa</span>n>, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Maison Martin <span class="brand" style="color: red">Margie<<span class="brand" style="color: red">/span>la</span></span>, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Isabel Marant</<span class="brand" style="color: red">spa</span>n>, and <span class="brand" style="color: red">Lanvin</span>, <span class="brand" style="color: red">H&amp;M</span> reigns supreme when fusing high end designs with affordable p<span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>s that reach to the masses. &#160;Neoprene, black, and more neoprene, and more black! &#160;As one of my favorite fabrics and colors, Wang scored a perfect 10 in my book. &#160;The collection is so p<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>llel to my personal style of being sporty-chic, I just couldn't resist!

The Los <span class="brand" style="color: red">Angel</span>es Auto show is a convention&#160;that happens every year. &#160;The last time I could remember attending the LA Auto show, I was too young to know the significance of car brands, details of interiors and the need for speed.&#160; Yesterday was a great reminder of that. &#160;From working with <span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span> USA on the #PAIDM<span class="brand" style="color: red">YD</span>UES campaign to owning my first luxury car, being an <span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span>, I shared my LA Auto Show experience with none other than the&#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span> team. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span>'s&#160;new head of design in Germany&#160;spoke for the first time and unveiled a concept car,&#160;the A9. &#160;There was also the latest and fastest R8 ever and the all-new TT on the show floor. &#160;Infiniti, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Merc</span>edes Maybach and <span class="brand" style="color: red">Porsche</span> were few of the many other luxury cars that accompanied the showroom.&#160; @JoeyBrezinski &#160;, @ChristianRich , and&#160; @GuillermoAndrade &#160;were&#160;in attendance as well. &#160;The night ended at the London West <span class="brand" style="color: red">Hollywood</span> as <span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span> hosted a party to celebrate the&#160;unveilings&#160;and years of success. &#160;I enjoyed every bit of it!

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</span> #Sneakerboots are one of many <span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</span> shoes that provide comfort and protection. &#160;Six Los <span class="brand" style="color: red">Angel</span>es natives (including myself), were able to live the day in sneakerboots while capturing its essence for <span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</s<span class="brand" style="color: red">pan> Sportswear</span>. &#160;With different shapes, colors, and textures, everyone soon learned about the various styles of the sneakerboots. &#160;As you can see, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</span> does a phenomenal job of revolutionizing sneakers. &#160;It's more than just a shoe, it shows a way of life, and learning how to be prepared! &#160;Here's a recap to share my experience of what went down that Saturday, fast forward to seeing the finishing product at <span class="brand" style="color: red">Blend</span>s LA in downtown Los <span class="brand" style="color: red">Angel</span>es.

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>ngratulations to my friend @TheophilusLondon for a great album! &#160;The title, "Vibes" is self-explanatory. &#160;The album was executive produced by Kanye West. &#160;The artwork and photography was taken by icon <span class="brand" style="color: red">Karl Lagerfeld</span>. &#160;"Vibes" provides nothing less than high quality rhymes, rhythms, beats, and fashion! &#160;I first met Theo about three years ago at a Been Trill x Hood By Air brunch in New <span class="brand" style="color: red">York</span>. &#160;It was my first fashion week ever attended and I was so excited to be in the streets, seeing everyone dolled up for these fun-filled days of <span class="brand" style="color: red">endless</span> runways and fashion parties. &#160;Three years ago, Theo still had his solid silhouette of large hats and high end tops with jeans and boots. &#160;It was almost intimidating to meet someone with so much style, I knew I had to come correct. &#160;Since then, I noticed Theo in <span class="brand" style="color: red">Karl Lagerfeld</span>'s "Little Black <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jack</span>et" book, attending runways in Paris, and on the regular television in car commercials... even the video presentation for <span class="brand" style="color: red">Apple</span>'s iPhone 6 on apple.com. &#160;Theo has been a great mentor and friend and has always done everything with so much swag!
I had the opportunity to be apart of Theo's album, "Vibes". &#160;He called, wanting me to hear the album and while sitting there amazed by the records, he asked to make my voice one of the official "Vibes" sample voice overs. &#160;I had never done special <span class="brand" style="color: red">FX</span>, nor was I rapper (haha). Virgil Abloh and Benji B. then triggered all album sound-bytes. &#160;So if you listen to songs like "Water Me" and "Get Right" and hear a calm voices repeating "vibessss", you know that's me! &#160;

There have been so many opportunities presented this year and they were&#160;all great experiences. &#160;I've learned so much this year and look forward to what 2015 has to offer. &#160;Here are 5 of many moments I've enjoyed in the year of 2014. &#160;Thank you to everyone's love and support, I couldn't have done it without anyone involved in each of these moments. &#160;
5. Five Days with &#160; Fleur du Mal &#160;was an instagram blast of their latest lovely leather bra. &#160;Each day there was a post on different outfits&#160;wearing the leather bra.&#160;The quality of all the brands pieces are amazing and comfortable. &#160;Fleur du Mal is fun, flirty, a little dirty and so sexy! They specialize in dressing up and underdressing.&#160;Ladies if you haven't heard, please visit their site!&#160; This was exciting as I worked with&#160;film photographer,&#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Christina</span> Paik. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Ever</span>y time we come together its always magic being made. &#160;

4. The <span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>veteur interview was probably the quickest shoot I've done, and by far one of the most personal, showcasing my closet, my style, and items I've grown an attachment to. &#160;I was so ecstatic for this opportunity to be on The <span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>veteur&#160;next to&#160;some of my idols in fashion such as Pharrell , <span class="brand" style="color: red">Anna</span> <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dell</span>o&#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>o and Olivier Rousteing of <span class="brand" style="color: red">Balmain</span> . &#160;

3. HYPEBE<span class="brand" style="color: red">AST</span>.COM Interview was an interview to voice my opinion and answer questions about women in street wear and fashion trends amidst the digital generation. &#160;This interview was unlike any interview I've done before. &#160;It hit close to heart as being a women in the street wear world is still new and improving. &#160;Women are making their mark everyday whether it's in or out of the street wear culture, and everyones contribution counts. &#160;The digital generation is also new and the pros and cons of the internet bring up so many questions about where will this all go... are we moving too fast? Can we keep up? So many questions!!!&#160;

UO PREVIEW : "This month at UO, we're inspired by duos of all kinds, whether it's couples or coworkers, bandmates or brothers: sometimes the best, most unexpected results come from the power of two, and we're diving into these stories to learn more about lots of different pairs. One of our favorite discoveries is the creative collaboration of&#160;Aleali May&#160;and <span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> Park. A stylist force to be reckoned with, Aleali has her hands in tons of different compelling facets of the fashion world, from her start working with clothing brands as a teenager to today working as a stylist and image consultant. On the other side is her partner in crime <span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> Park, who shoots the editorials that Aleali styles for her blog and is the behind-the-scenes man turning her ideas into reality. One afternoon in LA, we decided to flip the lens and pair them together for a shoot reflective of their signature minimal-modern style, having them both put their own twist on some of our favorite black and white UO pieces, and divulge more about their personal style.&#160;"

My friend <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jane</span> wanted to bring me to this club called <span class="brand" style="color: red">Cali</span>gulla but I told her I&#8217;m gonna call off the night because I had to wake up early tomorrow. I know myself when I go clubbing &#8212; I drink an awful lot, do some stuff and dance till it&#8217;s 6 or 7 in the morning.
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Preventi</span>on is better than cure.
So off I went to the hotel, checked my emails a little bit and then Mark&#8217;s friend Valery called me to checked what I was doing. She said she had 2 friends who wanted to see me and asked if they can drop by at my room and maybe we can all have a chat. I said ok &#8212; as long as we&#8217;re not going out etc cause I had to wake up early tomorrow.
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Fas</span>t forward 1 hour later, Valery, Natasha and Yulia (the one with the blonde bangs) arrived.
All girls are soo soo fun. Natasha&#8217;s english is great. Whereas Yulia&#8230; oh my god, Yulia is just like "Bubbles" from Absolutely <span class="brand" style="color: red">Fab</span>ulous. She&#8217;s one crazy girl &#8211; she&#8217;s a journalist of some sort for some <span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>ian Mu<span class="brand" style="color: red">sic</span>/<span class="brand" style="color: red">MTV</span>-like channel. She likes to make these little facial things which are sooo cute. I have this body shimmer powder thing and we played around with it like little teenage girls. LOL.

DAY 1: THE ISLA<span class="brand" style="color: red">ND</span> OF NGOR
The first day landing in Senegal, I visited the island of Ngor. &#160;Traveling by boat to the island, we had a traditional Senegalese meal that included fish, <span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>, chicken, a sauce containing onions and carrots, and beer. &#160;On the island, there were many locals that sold art, handmade jewelry, and clothing from traditional fabrics. &#160;The streets were tagged with graffiti art and paintings that expressed the minds of the locals. &#160;Ngor is known for its laid back environment&#160;and is the home to many surfers.
DAY 2: THE ISLA<span class="brand" style="color: red">ND</span> OF GOR&#201;E
I had the privilege of visiting the island of Gor&#233;e. &#160;The island is known for its astounding history. &#160;Our friend, born and&#160;raised on the island of Gor&#233;e, gave us the insiders tour. &#160;My favorite and most emotional part about the island was visiting the House of Slaves. &#160;The place where&#160;over 12 million slaves were shipped all throughout the&#160;Americas, Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and many other places. &#160; We had a chance to stand in each room where the slaves were sep<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>ted by sex and age. &#160;Reflecting on the conditions and seeing the Door of No Return, made it emotional for everyone. &#160;The Door&#160;of No Return reflects the moment the slaves were&#160;shipped away, to never see their homes again. It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive. &#160;Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history. &#160;There are also monumental&#160;canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Art</span> on the island of Gor&#233;e is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac! This was one of my best days spent in <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dakar</span>, Senegal. &#160;I could never forget this day.
DAY 3: CHEZ&#160;SALIM - LAC&#160;ROSE&#160;&amp;&#160;The&#160;Seed Project's <span class="brand" style="color: red">Culture<span class="brand" style="color: red"></sp</span>an> Night
Lac Rose, also known as the Pink <span class="brand" style="color: red">Lake</span>, was once a lake filled with fish. &#160;Later, the fish ended up disappearing one by one and the lake produced salt. &#160;With the position of the sun and also the salt, the lake can give off the same effect of pink lemonade (but not as delightful if you drink it). &#160;Men and women gather buckets and boats of salt and divide them into sections on the shore. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Mo</span>st of the salt is exported and used in cities that need salt for the ground, to disintegrate the ice on the sidewalks. &#160;We visited the nearby villages, sand dunes and&#160;the beach. &#160;This whole journey was brought to us by four wheelers and a tour guide. &#160;Crops of <span class="brand" style="color: red">mint</span> and turnips grew in between villages, with even a fresh water supply dug from the ground. &#160;After the festivities, we ate on the shores local restaurant and later attended culture night at The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span>.
DAY 4 &amp; 5: &#160;THE SEED AC<span class="brand" style="color: red">AD</span>EMY&#160;
The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> is a non profit organization that runs an academy for young boys and girls. &#160;They use basketball and education as their platform to prepare opportunities in Senegal. &#160;With both education and talent, kids are prone to opportunities outside&#160;of Africa with scholarships and many more benefits. &#160;The days spent with the Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> were amazing. &#160;The kids had been working hard and playing against each other all season in basketball games called the Hoop Forum. &#160;For lunch that day, we had a traditional Senegalese meal with local drinks of ginger, chicken and saut&#233;ed onion, and <span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>. &#160;The&#160;last day held the final game at the Marius Ndiaye Stadium. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">East</span> won vs. West as <span class="brand" style="color: red">NBA</span> players <span class="brand" style="color: red">Wilson</span> Chandler of the Denver Nuggets&#160;and Gorgui Dieng of the Minnesota Timberwolves helped coach both sides. &#160;The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> showed so much love and were great hosts during my stay in Senegal. &#160;This isn't a farewell message, 'cause I'll be back!

Friday Fix
<span class="brand" style="color: red">T-Bags</span> is one of my favorite brands and I just snagged this fantastic one shoulder tunic dress from Saks.com. The necklace comes with it! (yay) Unfortunately I'm really good at justifying my purchases...
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Just</span>ification #1, it's Friday and isn't Friday the most indulgent day of the week? I mean really...you eat pizza for lunch, have drinks after work, make unnecessary purchases...
#2 It's on sale! Need I say more?
#3 Because of my work there are so many events to attend and wouldn't it really be re<span class="brand" style="color: red">miss</span> of me to not buy this as I may have an event or outing pop up and I'll have nothing to wear and won't go thus <span class="brand" style="color: red">miss</span>ing out on some amazing work opportunity having not met a great contact?
See? I need this.

A bit of an intro if you will...
I've been working in fashion &amp; entertainment for nearly 10 years and as a plus size, African American female you can guess that my journey has at times been quite interesting.
Having worked with fashion brands &amp; retailers both plus and straight size, I've had the chance to see the industry change quite dramatically over the last few years and it's exciting! As a publicist I've worked with magazines including InStyle, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Glamour<span class="brand" style="color: red"></sp</span>an>, O the <span class="brand" style="color: red">Op</span>rah <span class="brand" style="color: red">Magazine</span> and many others but I'd really love to see more than one "curvy girl" outfit on 300+ pages.
My goal is to share some of my adventures, fashion that I love and where to find it...There's <span class="brand" style="color: red">SO</span> much more fashion available for sizes 10 and larger these days (no excuse for boxy tees and pleated khakis). I'll begin posting in the next few days - Follow me :)

I really do *heart* Ronson
I've been a very naughty girl...I've become <span class="brand" style="color: red">add</span>icted to updating via Facebook. Sorry blogspot heh. Well it's been a while but I had such a fun experience on a very random and unexpected trip to JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey that I needed a little more room to express myself than Facebook allows.
So here goes...my good friend and stylist Meeka <span class="brand" style="color: red">Johnson</span> is great for hipping me to stores I either have never checked out or wouldn't give a chance. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Case</span> in point...JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey. I'd never go in there, no offense just not my speed, or so I thought. She popped up with bags FULL of really cool clothes from the mega retailer that I would have never ever...ever guessed came from "<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey's" as we call it. Meeka is a 5'9 curvy girl but not exactly plus size but she encouraged me to check out JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey's <span class="brand" style="color: red">I Heart Ronson</span>, Bisou Bisou, She Said... and others. They aren't plus brands but I found a few really cute things that fit and are super cute! My little sis came along for the ride and found a great fushia rumper and harem pants on the cle<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>nce rack. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Love</span> it! I'll post pics of me in some of the outfits soon.

My lifestyle has changed dramatically and thus, my wardrobe.

Luckily I was able to snap a few shots of the room's art with my camera phone and a friend of mine had a camera on hand to take a picture of me (I don't love the look on my face but when someone is doing a favor you can't have photoshoot style do'overs, a'well). <span class="brand" style="color: red">Inspire</span>d by the room, this post is a collage of the art and photo of me...

Brrrr!!!
So, today was the very first day I needed a winter accessory and though I probably love to accessorize more than any one normal person should, this made me a little sad. It was a beautiful fall day in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and though sunny, the wind was a bit out of control. Last time I was in Ph<span class="brand" style="color: red">illy</span> visiting the fam I snagged this gray and yellow knit hat complete with adorable ball and took it out for a test run today. Had brunch at Yatanga in Harlem (must try, very cool space!)My hat...really quite warm and cozy (<span class="brand" style="color: red">Nordstrom</span>).

Gym |clothes| Rat|s|
I officially hate all of my gym clothes. Yesterday I threw on a pair of tights and a long fitted deep v neck tee and finally felt cute at the gym. I think I might seriously be allergic to crew neck teeshirts with that yucky seamed collar makes me soooo sad! The tights I wore however, I don't want to ruin, wear out or snag with my eliptical shenanigans and on the floor bendy "core" workout. I think I'm going to give these <span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</span> Runner's Tech joints a try. They are a bit p<span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>y for work out gear but are on sale so...I'm going to give them a whirl.

OOTD: Bad Kitty!
Pre-Halloween party I attended was beyond fun. My costume was challenging because the party I went to is one where you dance, a lot...so being comfortable and having a non-cumbersome costume that won't fall apart when you twirl around 100 times in a row is key. Here's what I wore: Layered tank/sleeveless cardigan, tights that lace up the sides, and my <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> by Barefoot <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> "Japanese" boots. Added to that are kitty ears, a bell around my neck which I pulled off a studded collar and put onto a leather choker, fingerless faux leather studded gloves and of course no Bad Kitty is completed without a pink and black whip. I of course did a terrible job at remember to take pics before the party and sweaty post dancing makeup madness. But here's a little something. I'll do better next time, PROMISE!

I've mentioned on the Facebook Fatshion Insider page that I've more recently been gravitating toward black. Although I'm a fairly smiley person black makes me feel so TOUGH, haha! This jacket you're likely to see a lot. This asymetrical blazer styled jacket (leather front and jersey/sweatshirt material in the back) is sooooo easy to wear. I can throw it over anything and will. My harem styled jeans and hankercheif hem tank complete the outfit.
Honestly I cannot remember where I got the tank but the <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jack</span>et came from a random boutique in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and the jeans in LA - I know, sorry.

After going to Pushkin Palace, the boys decided to throw a little indoor goo<span class="brand" style="color: red">db</span>ye party for me at the hotel. We went to a real <span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>ian market, bought some food, some caviar (US$30 for 1 kilogram), then to a supermarket to buy some booze, then called a special "someone" to get some "stuff"&#8230; if you know what I mean. ;)
As soon as we got into my room, bam!!! Fun, fun, fun!. I had 2 of the boys try on some my stuff cause they all looked like gansgters in black. LOL. I asked Poletay (see below) to try my <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dior</span> boots on and another guy to try my fox jacket and pose like a pimp.

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>ngratulations to my friend @TheophilusLondon for a great album! &#160;The title, "Vibes" is self-explanatory. &#160;The album was executive produced by Kanye West. &#160;The artwork and photography was taken by icon <span class="brand" style="color: red">Karl Lagerfeld</span>. &#160;"Vibes" provides nothing less than high quality rhymes, rhythms, beats, and fashion! &#160;I first met Theo about three years ago at a Been Trill x Hood By Air brunch in New <span class="brand" style="color: red">York</span>. &#160;It was my first fashion week ever attended and I was so excited to be in the streets, seeing everyone dolled up for these fun-filled days of <span class="brand" style="color: red">endless</span> runways and fashion parties. &#160;Three years ago, Theo still had his solid silhouette of large hats and high end tops with jeans and boots. &#160;It was almost intimidating to meet someone with so much style, I knew I had to come correct. &#160;Since then, I noticed Theo in <span class="brand" style="color: red">Karl Lagerfeld</span>'s "Little Black <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jack</span>et" book, attending runways in Paris, and on the regular television in car commercials... even the video presentation for <span class="brand" style="color: red">Apple</span>'s iPhone 6 on apple.com. &#160;Theo has been a great mentor and friend and has always done everything with so much swag!
I had the opportunity to be apart of Theo's album, "Vibes". &#160;He called, wanting me to hear the album and while sitting there amazed by the records, he asked to make my voice one of the official "Vibes" sample voice overs. &#160;I had never done special <span class="brand" style="color: red">FX</span>, nor was I rapper (haha). Virgil Abloh and Benji B. then triggered all album sound-bytes. &#160;So if you listen to songs like "Water Me" and "Get Right" and hear a calm voices repeating "vibessss", you know that's me! &#160;

There have been so many opportunities presented this year and they were&#160;all great experiences. &#160;I've learned so much this year and look forward to what 2015 has to offer. &#160;Here are 5 of many moments I've enjoyed in the year of 2014. &#160;Thank you to everyone's love and support, I couldn't have done it without anyone involved in each of these moments. &#160;
5. Five Days with &#160; Fleur du Mal &#160;was an instagram blast of their latest lovely leather bra. &#160;Each day there was a post on different outfits&#160;wearing the leather bra.&#160;The quality of all the brands pieces are amazing and comfortable. &#160;Fleur du Mal is fun, flirty, a little dirty and so sexy! They specialize in dressing up and underdressing.&#160;Ladies if you haven't heard, please visit their site!&#160; This was exciting as I worked with&#160;film photographer,&#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Christina</span> Paik. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Ever</span>y time we come together its always magic being made. &#160;

4. The <span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>veteur interview was probably the quickest shoot I've done, and by far one of the most personal, showcasing my closet, my style, and items I've grown an attachment to. &#160;I was so ecstatic for this opportunity to be on The <span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>veteur&#160;next to&#160;some of my idols in fashion such as Pharrell , <span class="brand" style="color: red">Anna</span> <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dell</span>o&#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>o and Olivier Rousteing of <span class="brand" style="color: red">Balmain</span> . &#160;

3. HYPEBE<span class="brand" style="color: red">AST</span>.COM Interview was an interview to voice my opinion and answer questions about women in street wear and fashion trends amidst the digital generation. &#160;This interview was unlike any interview I've done before. &#160;It hit close to heart as being a women in the street wear world is still new and improving. &#160;Women are making their mark everyday whether it's in or out of the street wear culture, and everyones contribution counts. &#160;The digital generation is also new and the pros and cons of the internet bring up so many questions about where will this all go... are we moving too fast? Can we keep up? So many questions!!!&#160;

UO PREVIEW : "This month at UO, we're inspired by duos of all kinds, whether it's couples or coworkers, bandmates or brothers: sometimes the best, most unexpected results come from the power of two, and we're diving into these stories to learn more about lots of different pairs. One of our favorite discoveries is the creative collaboration of&#160;Aleali May&#160;and <span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> Park. A stylist force to be reckoned with, Aleali has her hands in tons of different compelling facets of the fashion world, from her start working with clothing brands as a teenager to today working as a stylist and image consultant. On the other side is her partner in crime <span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> Park, who shoots the editorials that Aleali styles for her blog and is the behind-the-scenes man turning her ideas into reality. One afternoon in LA, we decided to flip the lens and pair them together for a shoot reflective of their signature minimal-modern style, having them both put their own twist on some of our favorite black and white UO pieces, and divulge more about their personal style.&#160;"

My friend <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jane</span> wanted to bring me to this club called <span class="brand" style="color: red">Cali</span>gulla but I told her I&#8217;m gonna call off the night because I had to wake up early tomorrow. I know myself when I go clubbing &#8212; I drink an awful lot, do some stuff and dance till it&#8217;s 6 or 7 in the morning.
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Preventi</span>on is better than cure.
So off I went to the hotel, checked my emails a little bit and then Mark&#8217;s friend Valery called me to checked what I was doing. She said she had 2 friends who wanted to see me and asked if they can drop by at my room and maybe we can all have a chat. I said ok &#8212; as long as we&#8217;re not going out etc cause I had to wake up early tomorrow.
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Fas</span>t forward 1 hour later, Valery, Natasha and Yulia (the one with the blonde bangs) arrived.
All girls are soo soo fun. Natasha&#8217;s english is great. Whereas Yulia&#8230; oh my god, Yulia is just like "Bubbles" from Absolutely <span class="brand" style="color: red">Fab</span>ulous. She&#8217;s one crazy girl &#8211; she&#8217;s a journalist of some sort for some <span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>ian Mu<span class="brand" style="color: red">sic</span>/<span class="brand" style="color: red">MTV</span>-like channel. She likes to make these little facial things which are sooo cute. I have this body shimmer powder thing and we played around with it like little teenage girls. LOL.
Natasha, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Mo</span>i, Yulia at my room
Yulia, Natasha, Valery

DAY 1: THE ISLA<span class="brand" style="color: red">ND</span> OF NGOR
The first day landing in Senegal, I visited the island of Ngor. &#160;Traveling by boat to the island, we had a traditional Senegalese meal that included fish, <span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>, chicken, a sauce containing onions and carrots, and beer. &#160;On the island, there were many locals that sold art, handmade jewelry, and clothing from traditional fabrics. &#160;The streets were tagged with graffiti art and paintings that expressed the minds of the locals. &#160;Ngor is known for its laid back environment&#160;and is the home to many surfers.
DAY 2: THE ISLA<span class="brand" style="color: red">ND</span> OF GOR&#201;E
I had the privilege of visiting the island of Gor&#233;e. &#160;The island is known for its astounding history. &#160;Our friend, born and&#160;raised on the island of Gor&#233;e, gave us the insiders tour. &#160;My favorite and most emotional part about the island was visiting the House of Slaves. &#160;The place where&#160;over 12 million slaves were shipped all throughout the&#160;Americas, Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and many other places. &#160; We had a chance to stand in each room where the slaves were sep<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>ted by sex and age. &#160;Reflecting on the conditions and seeing the Door of No Return, made it emotional for everyone. &#160;The Door&#160;of No Return reflects the moment the slaves were&#160;shipped away, to never see their homes again. It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive. &#160;Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history. &#160;There are also monumental&#160;canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Art</span> on the island of Gor&#233;e is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac! This was one of my best days spent in <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dakar</span>, Senegal. &#160;I could never forget this day.
DAY 3: CHEZ&#160;SALIM - LAC&#160;ROSE&#160;&amp;&#160;The&#160;Seed Project's <span class="brand" style="color: red">Culture<span class="brand" style="color: red"></sp</span>an> Night
Lac Rose, also known as the Pink <span class="brand" style="color: red">Lake</span>, was once a lake filled with fish. &#160;Later, the fish ended up disappearing one by one and the lake produced salt. &#160;With the position of the sun and also the salt, the lake can give off the same effect of pink lemonade (but not as delightful if you drink it). &#160;Men and women gather buckets and boats of salt and divide them into sections on the shore. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Mo</span>st of the salt is exported and used in cities that need salt for the ground, to disintegrate the ice on the sidewalks. &#160;We visited the nearby villages, sand dunes and&#160;the beach. &#160;This whole journey was brought to us by four wheelers and a tour guide. &#160;Crops of <span class="brand" style="color: red">mint</span> and turnips grew in between villages, with even a fresh water supply dug from the ground. &#160;After the festivities, we ate on the shores local restaurant and later attended culture night at The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span>.
DAY 4 &amp; 5: &#160;THE SEED AC<span class="brand" style="color: red">AD</span>EMY&#160;
The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> is a non profit organization that runs an academy for young boys and girls. &#160;They use basketball and education as their platform to prepare opportunities in Senegal. &#160;With both education and talent, kids are prone to opportunities outside&#160;of Africa with scholarships and many more benefits. &#160;The days spent with the Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> were amazing. &#160;The kids had been working hard and playing against each other all season in basketball games called the Hoop Forum. &#160;For lunch that day, we had a traditional Senegalese meal with local drinks of ginger, chicken and saut&#233;ed onion, and <span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>. &#160;The&#160;last day held the final game at the Marius Ndiaye Stadium. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">East</span> won vs. West as <span class="brand" style="color: red">NBA</span> players <span class="brand" style="color: red">Wilson</span> Chandler of the Denver Nuggets&#160;and Gorgui Dieng of the Minnesota Timberwolves helped coach both sides. &#160;The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> showed so much love and were great hosts during my stay in Senegal. &#160;This isn't a farewell message, 'cause I'll be back!

A bit of an intro if you will...
I've been working in fashion &amp; entertainment for nearly 10 years and as a plus size, African American female you can guess that my journey has at times been quite interesting.
Having worked with fashion brands &amp; retailers both plus and straight size, I've had the chance to see the industry change quite dramatically over the last few years and it's exciting! As a publicist I've worked with magazines including InStyle, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Glamour<span class="brand" style="color: red"></sp</span>an>, O the <span class="brand" style="color: red">Op</span>rah <span class="brand" style="color: red">Magazine</span> and many others but I'd really love to see more than one "curvy girl" outfit on 300+ pages.
My goal is to share some of my adventures, fashion that I love and where to find it...There's <span class="brand" style="color: red">SO</span> much more fashion available for sizes 10 and larger these days (no excuse for boxy tees and pleated khakis). I'll begin posting in the next few days - Follow me :)

I really do *heart* Ronson
I've been a very naughty girl...I've become <span class="brand" style="color: red">add</span>icted to updating via Facebook. Sorry blogspot heh. Well it's been a while but I had such a fun experience on a very random and unexpected trip to JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey that I needed a little more room to express myself than Facebook allows.
So here goes...my good friend and stylist Meeka <span class="brand" style="color: red">Johnson</span> is great for hipping me to stores I either have never checked out or wouldn't give a chance. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Case</span> in point...JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey. I'd never go in there, no offense just not my speed, or so I thought. She popped up with bags FULL of really cool clothes from the mega retailer that I would have never ever...ever guessed came from "<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey's" as we call it. Meeka is a 5'9 curvy girl but not exactly plus size but she encouraged me to check out JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey's <span class="brand" style="color: red">I Heart Ronson</span>, Bisou Bisou, She Said... and others. They aren't plus brands but I found a few really cute things that fit and are super cute! My little sis came along for the ride and found a great fushia rumper and harem pants on the cle<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>nce rack. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Love</span> it! I'll post pics of me in some of the outfits soon.

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Just</span> got back from the incredible Turks &amp; Caicos islands had a blast...just a super quick posting of what I wore on one of my fav days running back and forth from the beach to the pool with my sis.

It fit great and was super cute :) (I think anyways)...The sarong I got from a very random and slightly sketchy open market in Jamaica earlier this year where along with the sarong the man tried to sell me some "smoke" lol.

My lifestyle has changed dramatically and thus, my wardrobe.

Luckily I was able to snap a few shots of the room's art with my camera phone and a friend of mine had a camera on hand to take a picture of me (I don't love the look on my face but when someone is doing a favor you can't have photoshoot style do'overs, a'well). <span class="brand" style="color: red">Inspire</span>d by the room, this post is a collage of the art and photo of me...

Brrrr!!!
So, today was the very first day I needed a winter accessory and though I probably love to accessorize more than any one normal person should, this made me a little sad. It was a beautiful fall day in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and though sunny, the wind was a bit out of control. Last time I was in Ph<span class="brand" style="color: red">illy</span> visiting the fam I snagged this gray and yellow knit hat complete with adorable ball and took it out for a test run today. Had brunch at Yatanga in Harlem (must try, very cool space!)My hat...really quite warm and cozy (<span class="brand" style="color: red">Nordstrom</span>).

Granny Goes to War in...Vermont?
Barefoot <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> might well be my absolute favorite online shoe store. Being a 5'10 big foot gal can make shoe shopping annoying at best and I really am not going to settle for shoes that make me sad so, Barefoot<span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span>.com to the rescue.

Gym |clothes| Rat|s|
I officially hate all of my gym clothes. Yesterday I threw on a pair of tights and a long fitted deep v neck tee and finally felt cute at the gym. I think I might seriously be allergic to crew neck teeshirts with that yucky seamed collar makes me soooo sad! The tights I wore however, I don't want to ruin, wear out or snag with my eliptical shenanigans and on the floor bendy "core" workout. I think I'm going to give these <span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</span> Runner's Tech joints a try. They are a bit p<span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>y for work out gear but are on sale so...I'm going to give them a whirl.

Ok...<span class="brand" style="color: red">Mo</span>nif C's new holiday looks are ridiculously fly.

I Wear White Whenever I Want!
Yes, it's October in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and I'm wearing white jeans. I've decided I really love white jeans and plan on wearing them whenver I feel like it (smile). So here they are! I love this pair as they have tan stitching which really <span class="brand" style="color: red">add</span> interest.

OOTD: Bad Kitty!
Pre-Halloween party I attended was beyond fun. My costume was challenging because the party I went to is one where you dance, a lot...so being comfortable and having a non-cumbersome costume that won't fall apart when you twirl around 100 times in a row is key. Here's what I wore: Layered tank/sleeveless cardigan, tights that lace up the sides, and my <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> by Barefoot <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> "Japanese" boots. Added to that are kitty ears, a bell around my neck which I pulled off a studded collar and put onto a leather choker, fingerless faux leather studded gloves and of course no Bad Kitty is completed without a pink and black whip. I of course did a terrible job at remember to take pics before the party and sweaty post dancing makeup madness. But here's a little something. I'll do better next time, PROMISE!

OOTD - Tough <span class="brand" style="color: red">Stuf</s<span class="brand" style="color: red">pan>f</span>
I've mentioned on the Facebook Fatshion Insider page that I've more recently been gravitating toward black. Although I'm a fairly smiley person black makes me feel so TOUGH, haha! This jacket you're likely to see a lot. This asymetrical blazer styled jacket (leather front and jersey/sweatshirt material in the back) is sooooo easy to wear. I can throw it over anything and will. My harem styled jeans and hankercheif hem tank complete the outfit.
Honestly I cannot remember where I got the tank but the <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jack</span>et came from a random boutique in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and the jeans in LA - I know, sorry.

After going to Pushkin Palace, the boys decided to throw a little indoor goo<span class="brand" style="color: red">db</span>ye party for me at the hotel. We went to a real <span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>ian market, bought some food, some caviar (US$30 for 1 kilogram), then to a supermarket to buy some booze, then called a special "someone" to get some "stuff"&#8230; if you know what I mean. ;)
As soon as we got into my room, bam!!! Fun, fun, fun!. I had 2 of the boys try on some my stuff cause they all looked like gansgters in black. LOL. I asked Poletay (see below) to try my <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dior</span> boots on and another guy to try my fox jacket and pose like a pimp.

The Los <span class="brand" style="color: red">Angel</span>es Auto show is a convention&#160;that happens every year. &#160;The last time I could remember attending the LA Auto show, I was too young to know the significance of car brands, details of interiors and the need for speed.&#160; Yesterday was a great reminder of that. &#160;From working with <span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span> USA on the #PAIDM<span class="brand" style="color: red">YD</span>UES campaign to owning my first luxury car, being an <span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span>, I shared my LA Auto Show experience with none other than the&#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span> team. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span>'s&#160;new head of design in Germany&#160;spoke for the first time and unveiled a concept car,&#160;the A9. &#160;There was also the latest and fastest R8 ever and the all-new TT on the show floor. &#160;Infiniti, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Merc</span>edes Maybach and <span class="brand" style="color: red">Porsche</span> were few of the many other luxury cars that accompanied the showroom.&#160; @JoeyBrezinski &#160;, @ChristianRich , and&#160; @GuillermoAndrade &#160;were&#160;in attendance as well. &#160;The night ended at the London West <span class="brand" style="color: red">Hollywood</span> as <span class="brand" style="color: red">Audi</span> hosted a party to celebrate the&#160;unveilings&#160;and years of success. &#160;I enjoyed every bit of it!

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Co</span>ngratulations to my friend @TheophilusLondon for a great album! &#160;The title, "Vibes" is self-explanatory. &#160;The album was executive produced by Kanye West. &#160;The artwork and photography was taken by icon <span class="brand" style="color: red">Karl Lagerfeld</span>. &#160;"Vibes" provides nothing less than high quality rhymes, rhythms, beats, and fashion! &#160;I first met Theo about three years ago at a Been Trill x Hood By Air brunch in New <span class="brand" style="color: red">York</span>. &#160;It was my first fashion week ever attended and I was so excited to be in the streets, seeing everyone dolled up for these fun-filled days of <span class="brand" style="color: red">endless</span> runways and fashion parties. &#160;Three years ago, Theo still had his solid silhouette of large hats and high end tops with jeans and boots. &#160;It was almost intimidating to meet someone with so much style, I knew I had to come correct. &#160;Since then, I noticed Theo in <span class="brand" style="color: red">Karl Lagerfeld</span>'s "Little Black <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jack</span>et" book, attending runways in Paris, and on the regular television in car commercials... even the video presentation for <span class="brand" style="color: red">Apple</span>'s iPhone 6 on apple.com. &#160;Theo has been a great mentor and friend and has always done everything with so much swag!
I had the opportunity to be apart of Theo's album, "Vibes". &#160;He called, wanting me to hear the album and while sitting there amazed by the records, he asked to make my voice one of the official "Vibes" sample voice overs. &#160;I had never done special <span class="brand" style="color: red">FX</span>, nor was I rapper (haha). Virgil Abloh and Benji B. then triggered all album sound-bytes. &#160;So if you listen to songs like "Water Me" and "Get Right" and hear a calm voices repeating "vibessss", you know that's me! &#160;

There have been so many opportunities presented this year and they were&#160;all great experiences. &#160;I've learned so much this year and look forward to what 2015 has to offer. &#160;Here are 5 of many moments I've enjoyed in the year of 2014. &#160;Thank you to everyone's love and support, I couldn't have done it without anyone involved in each of these moments. &#160;
5. Five Days with &#160; Fleur du Mal &#160;was an instagram blast of their latest lovely leather bra. &#160;Each day there was a post on different outfits&#160;wearing the leather bra.&#160;The quality of all the brands pieces are amazing and comfortable. &#160;Fleur du Mal is fun, flirty, a little dirty and so sexy!

3. HYPEBE<span class="brand" style="color: red">AST</span>.COM Interview was an interview to voice my opinion and answer questions about women in street wear and fashion trends amidst the digital generation. &#160;This interview was unlike any interview I've done before. &#160;It hit close to heart as being a women in the street wear world is still new and improving. &#160;Women are making their mark everyday whether it's in or out of the street wear culture, and everyones contribution counts. &#160;The digital generation is also new and the pros and cons of the internet bring up so many questions about where will this all go... are we moving too fast? Can we keep up? So many questions!!!&#160;

1. &#160;ALEALIMAY the site. &#160;This has been the best accomplishment&#160;of 2014 for me, as I launched this site a couple months ago. &#160;It took so long to actually put this into fruition but we're here! &#160;Without&#160;photographer @Allby<span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> and many others that contributed to this site, it wouldn't showcase my vision as great it does. &#160;On here I showcase events I attend, places I go, my experiences and outfits. &#160;I mean, no need to write too much on what blog is about... cause I've placed it in the ABOUT section (HA!). &#160;Thank you again for everyones support and tuning in every week. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Love</span>!

UO PREVIEW : "This month at UO, we're inspired by duos of all kinds, whether it's couples or coworkers, bandmates or brothers: sometimes the best, most unexpected results come from the power of two, and we're diving into these stories to learn more about lots of different pairs. One of our favorite discoveries is the creative collaboration of&#160;Aleali May&#160;and <span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> Park. A stylist force to be reckoned with, Aleali has her hands in tons of different compelling facets of the fashion world, from her start working with clothing brands as a teenager to today working as a stylist and image consultant. On the other side is her partner in crime <span class="brand" style="color: red">Allen</span> Park, who shoots the editorials that Aleali styles for her blog and is the behind-the-scenes man turning her ideas into reality. One afternoon in LA, we decided to flip the lens and pair them together for a shoot reflective of their signature minimal-modern style, having them both put their own twist on some of our favorite black and white UO pieces, and divulge more about their personal style.&#160;"

My friend <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jane</span> wanted to bring me to this club called <span class="brand" style="color: red">Cali</span>gulla but I told her I&#8217;m gonna call off the night because I had to wake up early tomorrow. I know myself when I go clubbing &#8212; I drink an awful lot, do some stuff and dance till it&#8217;s 6 or 7 in the morning.
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Preventi</span>on is better than cure.
So off I went to the hotel, checked my emails a little bit and then Mark&#8217;s friend Valery called me to checked what I was doing. She said she had 2 friends who wanted to see me and asked if they can drop by at my room and maybe we can all have a chat. I said ok &#8212; as long as we&#8217;re not going out etc cause I had to wake up early tomorrow.
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Fas</span>t forward 1 hour later, Valery, Natasha and Yulia (the one with the blonde bangs) arrived.
All girls are soo soo fun. Natasha&#8217;s english is great. Whereas Yulia&#8230; oh my god, Yulia is just like "Bubbles" from Absolutely <span class="brand" style="color: red">Fab</span>ulous. She&#8217;s one crazy girl &#8211; she&#8217;s a journalist of some sort for some <span class="brand" style="color: red">Russ</span>ian Mu<span class="brand" style="color: red">sic</span>/<span class="brand" style="color: red">MTV</span>-like channel.

DAY 1: THE ISLA<span class="brand" style="color: red">ND</span> OF NGOR
The first day landing in Senegal, I visited the island of Ngor. &#160;Traveling by boat to the island, we had a traditional Senegalese meal that included fish, <span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>, chicken, a sauce containing onions and carrots, and beer. &#160;On the island, there were many locals that sold art, handmade jewelry, and clothing from traditional fabrics. &#160;The streets were tagged with graffiti art and paintings that expressed the minds of the locals. &#160;Ngor is known for its laid back environment&#160;and is the home to many surfers.
DAY 2: THE ISLA<span class="brand" style="color: red">ND</span> OF GOR&#201;E
I had the privilege of visiting the island of Gor&#233;e. &#160;The island is known for its astounding history. &#160;Our friend, born and&#160;raised on the island of Gor&#233;e, gave us the insiders tour. &#160;My favorite and most emotional part about the island was visiting the House of Slaves. &#160;The place where&#160;over 12 million slaves were shipped all throughout the&#160;Americas, Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and many other places. &#160; We had a chance to stand in each room where the slaves were sep<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>ted by sex and age. &#160;Reflecting on the conditions and seeing the Door of No Return, made it emotional for everyone. &#160;The Door&#160;of No Return reflects the moment the slaves were&#160;shipped away, to never see their homes again. It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive. &#160;Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history. &#160;There are also monumental&#160;canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Art</span> on the island of Gor&#233;e is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac! This was one of my best days spent in <span class="brand" style="color: red">Dakar</span>, Senegal. &#160;I could never forget this day.
DAY 3: CHEZ&#160;SALIM - LAC&#160;ROSE&#160;&amp;&#160;The&#160;Seed Project's <span class="brand" style="color: red">Culture<span class="brand" style="color: red"></sp</span>an> Night
Lac Rose, also known as the Pink <span class="brand" style="color: red">Lake</span>, was once a lake filled with fish. &#160;Later, the fish ended up disappearing one by one and the lake produced salt. &#160;With the position of the sun and also the salt, the lake can give off the same effect of pink lemonade (but not as delightful if you drink it). &#160;Men and women gather buckets and boats of salt and divide them into sections on the shore. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">Mo</span>st of the salt is exported and used in cities that need salt for the ground, to disintegrate the ice on the sidewalks. &#160;We visited the nearby villages, sand dunes and&#160;the beach. &#160;This whole journey was brought to us by four wheelers and a tour guide. &#160;Crops of <span class="brand" style="color: red">mint</span> and turnips grew in between villages, with even a fresh water supply dug from the ground. &#160;After the festivities, we ate on the shores local restaurant and later attended culture night at The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span>.
DAY 4 &amp; 5: &#160;THE SEED AC<span class="brand" style="color: red">AD</span>EMY&#160;
The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> is a non profit organization that runs an academy for young boys and girls. &#160;They use basketball and education as their platform to prepare opportunities in Senegal. &#160;With both education and talent, kids are prone to opportunities outside&#160;of Africa with scholarships and many more benefits. &#160;The days spent with the Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> were amazing. &#160;The kids had been working hard and playing against each other all season in basketball games called the Hoop Forum. &#160;For lunch that day, we had a traditional Senegalese meal with local drinks of ginger, chicken and saut&#233;ed onion, and <span class="brand" style="color: red">rice</span>. &#160;The&#160;last day held the final game at the Marius Ndiaye Stadium. &#160;<span class="brand" style="color: red">East</span> won vs. West as <span class="brand" style="color: red">NBA</span> players <span class="brand" style="color: red">Wilson</span> Chandler of the Denver Nuggets&#160;and Gorgui Dieng of the Minnesota Timberwolves helped coach both sides. &#160;The Seed <span class="brand" style="color: red">Academy</span> showed so much love and were great hosts during my stay in Senegal. &#160;This isn't a farewell message, 'cause I'll be back!

Friday Fix
<span class="brand" style="color: red">T-Bags</span> is one of my favorite brands and I just snagged this fantastic one shoulder tunic dress from Saks.com. The necklace comes with it! (yay) Unfortunately I'm really good at justifying my purchases...
<span class="brand" style="color: red">Just</span>ification #1, it's Friday and isn't Friday the most indulgent day of the week? I mean really...you eat pizza for lunch, have drinks after work, make unnecessary purchases...
#2 It's on sale! Need I say more?

A bit of an intro if you will...
I've been working in fashion &amp; entertainment for nearly 10 years and as a plus size, African American female you can guess that my journey has at times been quite interesting.
Having worked with fashion brands &amp; retailers both plus and straight size, I've had the chance to see the industry change quite dramatically over the last few years and it's exciting! As a publicist I've worked with magazines including InStyle, <span class="brand" style="color: red">Glamour<span class="brand" style="color: red"></sp</span>an>, O the <span class="brand" style="color: red">Op</span>rah <span class="brand" style="color: red">Magazine</span> and many others but I'd really love to see more than one "curvy girl" outfit on 300+ pages.
My goal is to share some of my adventures, fashion that I love and where to find it...There's <span class="brand" style="color: red">SO</span> much more fashion available for sizes 10 and larger these days (no excuse for boxy tees and pleated khakis). I'll begin posting in the next few days - Follow me :)

I really do *heart* Ronson
I've been a very naughty girl...I've become <span class="brand" style="color: red">add</span>icted to updating via Facebook. Sorry blogspot heh. Well it's been a while but I had such a fun experience on a very random and unexpected trip to JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey that I needed a little more room to express myself than Facebook allows.
So here goes...my good friend and stylist Meeka <span class="brand" style="color: red">Johnson</span> is great for hipping me to stores I either have never checked out or wouldn't give a chance. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Case</span> in point...JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey. I'd never go in there, no offense just not my speed, or so I thought. She popped up with bags FULL of really cool clothes from the mega retailer that I would have never ever...ever guessed came from "<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey's" as we call it. Meeka is a 5'9 curvy girl but not exactly plus size but she encouraged me to check out JC<span class="brand" style="color: red">Penn</span>ey's <span class="brand" style="color: red">I Heart Ronson</span>, Bisou Bisou, She Said... and others. They aren't plus brands but I found a few really cute things that fit and are super cute! My little sis came along for the ride and found a great fushia rumper and harem pants on the cle<span class="brand" style="color: red">ara</span>nce rack. <span class="brand" style="color: red">Love</span> it! I'll post pics of me in some of the outfits soon.

<span class="brand" style="color: red">Just</span> got back from the incredible Turks &amp; Caicos islands had a blast...just a super quick posting of what I wore on one of my fav days running back and forth from the beach to the pool with my sis. She acutally saw this swimsuit and grabbed it for me...normally letting someone else buy you a swimsuit is a B<span class="brand" style="color: red">AD</span> idea but baby sis knows me oh so well.

My lifestyle has changed dramatically and thus, my wardrobe.

You can imagine my dismay when I realized I left my memory card in my laptop. Luckily I was able to snap a few shots of the room's art with my camera phone and a friend of mine had a camera on hand to take a picture of me (I don't love the look on my face but when someone is doing a favor you can't have photoshoot style do'overs, a'well). <span class="brand" style="color: red">Inspire</span>d by the room, this post is a collage of the art and photo of me...

Brrrr!!!
So, today was the very first day I needed a winter accessory and though I probably love to accessorize more than any one normal person should, this made me a little sad. It was a beautiful fall day in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and though sunny, the wind was a bit out of control. Last time I was in Ph<span class="brand" style="color: red">illy</span> visiting the fam I snagged this gray and yellow knit hat complete with adorable ball and took it out for a test run today. Had brunch at Yatanga in Harlem (must try, very cool space!)My hat...really quite warm and cozy (<span class="brand" style="color: red">Nordstrom</span>).

Barefoot <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> might well be my absolute favorite online shoe store.

Gym |clothes| Rat|s|
I officially hate all of my gym clothes. Yesterday I threw on a pair of tights and a long fitted deep v neck tee and finally felt cute at the gym. I think I might seriously be allergic to crew neck teeshirts with that yucky seamed collar makes me soooo sad! The tights I wore however, I don't want to ruin, wear out or snag with my eliptical shenanigans and on the floor bendy "core" workout. I think I'm going to give these <span class="brand" style="color: red">Nike</span> Runner's Tech joints a try.

Yes, it's October in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and I'm wearing white jeans. I've decided I really love white jeans and plan on wearing them whenver I feel like it (smile).

OOTD: Bad Kitty!
Pre-Halloween party I attended was beyond fun. My costume was challenging because the party I went to is one where you dance, a lot...so being comfortable and having a non-cumbersome costume that won't fall apart when you twirl around 100 times in a row is key. Here's what I wore: Layered tank/sleeveless cardigan, tights that lace up the sides, and my <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> by Barefoot <span class="brand" style="color: red">Tess</span> "Japanese" boots. Added to that are kitty ears, a bell around my neck which I pulled off a studded collar and put onto a leather choker, fingerless faux leather studded gloves and of course no Bad Kitty is completed without a pink and black whip. I of course did a terrible job at remember to take pics before the party and sweaty post dancing makeup madness. But here's a little something. I'll do better next time, PROMISE!

OOTD - Tough <span class="brand" style="color: red">Stuf</s<span class="brand" style="color: red">pan>f</span>
I've mentioned on the Facebook Fatshion Insider page that I've more recently been gravitating toward black. Although I'm a fairly smiley person black makes me feel so TOUGH, haha! This jacket you're likely to see a lot. This asymetrical blazer styled jacket (leather front and jersey/sweatshirt material in the back) is sooooo easy to wear. I can throw it over anything and will. My harem styled jeans and hankercheif hem tank complete the outfit.
Honestly I cannot remember where I got the tank but the <span class="brand" style="color: red">Jack</span>et came from a random boutique in <span class="brand" style="color: red">NYC</span> and the jeans in LA - I know, sorry.
