Virgil Abloh and Benji B. then triggered all album sound-bytes. &#160;So if you listen to songs like "Water Me" and "Get Right" and hear a calm voices repeating "vibessss", you know that's me! &#160; Theophilus London's new album Vibes, available HERE Stream the album HERE </section>

<section id="559be2c565f2886d5687b9de">Written By bryanboy My friend Jane wanted to bring me to this club called Caligulla but I told her I&#8217;m gonna call off the night because I had to wake up early tomorrow. I know myself when I go clubbing &#8212; I drink an awful lot, do some stuff and dance till it&#8217;s 6 or 7 in the morning. Prevention is better than cure. So off I went to the hotel, checked my emails a little bit and then Mark&#8217;s friend Valery called me to checked what I was doing. She said she had 2 friends who wanted to see me and asked if they can drop by at my room and maybe we can all have a chat. I said ok &#8212; as long as we&#8217;re not going out etc cause I had to wake up early tomorrow. Fast forward 1 hour later, Valery, Natasha and Yulia (the one with the blonde bangs) arrived. All girls are soo soo fun. Natasha&#8217;s english is great. Whereas Yulia&#8230; oh my god, Yulia is just like "Bubbles" from Absolutely Fabulous. She&#8217;s one crazy girl &#8211; she&#8217;s a journalist of some sort for some Russian Music/<span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">MTV</span>-like channel.

<section id="559be2cb65f2886d5687b9f1">Aleali May DAY 1: THE ISLAND OF NGOR The first day landing in Senegal, I visited the island of Ngor. &#160;Traveling by boat to the island, we had a traditional Senegalese meal that included fish, rice, chicken, a sauce containing onions and carrots, and beer. &#160;On the island, there were many locals that sold art, handmade jewelry, and clothing from traditional fabrics. &#160;The streets were tagged with graffiti art and paintings that expressed the minds of the locals. &#160;Ngor is known for its laid back environment&#160;and is the home to many surfers. DAY 2: THE ISLAND OF GOR&#201;E I had the privilege of visiting the island of Gor&#233;e. &#160;The island is known for its astounding history. &#160;Our friend, born and&#160;raised on the island of Gor&#233;e, gave us the insiders tour. &#160;My favorite and most emotional part about the island was visiting the House of Slaves. &#160;The place where&#160;over 12 million slaves were shipped all throughout the&#160;Americas, Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and many other places. &#160; We had a chance to stand in each room where the slaves were separated by sex and age. &#160;Reflecting on the conditions and seeing the Door of No Return, made it emotional for everyone. &#160;The Door&#160;of No Return reflects the moment the slaves were&#160;shipped away, to never see their homes again. It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive. &#160;Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history. &#160;There are also monumental&#160;canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings. &#160;Art on the island of Gor&#233;e is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac! This was one of my best days spent in Dakar, Senegal. &#160;I could never forget this day. DAY 3: CHEZ&#160;SALIM - LAC&#160;ROSE&#160;&amp;&#160;The&#160;Seed Project's Culture Night Lac Rose, also known as the Pink Lake, was once a lake filled with fish. &#160;Later, the fish ended up disappearing one by one and the lake produced salt. &#160;With the position of the sun and also the salt, the lake can give off the same effect of pink lemonade (but not as delightful if you drink it). &#160;Men and women gather buckets and boats of salt and divide them into sections on the shore. &#160;Most of the salt is exported and used in cities that need salt for the ground, to disintegrate the ice on the sidewalks. &#160;We visited the nearby villages, sand dunes and&#160;the beach. &#160;This whole journey was brought to us by four wheelers and a tour guide. &#160;Crops of mint and turnips grew in between villages, with even a fresh water supply dug from the ground. &#160;After the festivities, we ate on the shores local restaurant and later attended culture night at The Seed Academy. DAY 4 &amp; 5: &#160;THE SEED ACADEMY&#160; The Seed Academy is a non profit organization that runs an academy for young boys and girls. &#160;They use basketball and education as their platform to prepare opportunities in Senegal. &#160;With both education and talent, kids are prone to opportunities outside&#160;of Africa with scholarships and many more benefits. &#160;The days spent with the Seed Academy were amazing. &#160;The kids had been working hard and playing against each other all season in basketball games called the Hoop Forum. &#160;For lunch that day, we had a traditional Senegalese meal with local drinks of ginger, chicken and saut&#233;ed onion, and rice. &#160;The&#160;last day held the final game at the Marius Ndiaye Stadium. &#160;East won vs. West as <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">NBA</span> players Wilson Chandler of the <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Denver Nuggets</span>&#160;and Gorgui Dieng of the <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Minnesota Timberwolves</span> helped coach both sides. &#160;The Seed Academy showed so much love and were great hosts during my stay in Senegal. &#160;This isn't a farewell message, 'cause I'll be back! </section>

The necklace comes with it! (yay) Unfortunately I'm really good at justifying my purchases... Justification #1, it's Friday and isn't Friday the most indulgent day of the week? I mean really...you eat pizza for lunch, have drinks after work, make unnecessary purchases... #2 It's on sale! Need I say more? #3 Because of my work there are so many events to attend and wouldn't it really be remiss of me to not buy this as I may have an event or outing pop up and I'll have nothing to wear and won't go thus missing out on some amazing work opportunity having not met a great contact? See? I need this. </section>

<section id="559be2cf65f2886d5687ba01">Why Fatshion Insider...? A bit of an intro if you will... I've been working in fashion &amp; entertainment for nearly 10 years and as a plus size, African American female you can guess that my journey has at times been quite interesting. Having worked with fashion brands &amp; retailers both plus and straight size, I've had the chance to see the industry change quite dramatically over the last few years and it's exciting! As a publicist I've worked with magazines including InStyle, <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Glamour</span>, O the Oprah Magazine and many others but I'd really love to see more than one "curvy girl" outfit on 300+ pages. My goal is to share some of my adventures, fashion that I love and where to find it...There's SO much more fashion available for sizes 10 and larger these days (no excuse for boxy tees and pleated khakis). I'll begin posting in the next few days - Follow me :) xo, </section>

Just got back from the incredible Turks &amp; Caicos islands had a blast...just a super quick posting of what I wore on one of my fav days running back and forth from the beach to the pool with my sis. She acutally saw this swimsuit and grabbed it for me...normally letting someone else buy you a swimsuit is a BAD idea but baby sis knows me oh so well. It fit great and was super cute :) (I think anyways)...The sarong I got from a very random and slightly sketchy open market in Jamaica earlier this year where along with the sarong the man tried to sell me some "smoke" lol.

I have so many "fancy" clothes...being a fashion/entertainment publicist does require a good amount of going out but because I work for myself and not a corporate office anymore, I get to rule my wardrobe the way that I like. Basics are hard for me because they are usually a bit boring but I challanged myself to scope out a site that I feel is nothing but basics, <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Old Navy</span>.

I managed to remember my camera and was so excited to see the party had moved to the basement which had an incredible lounge filled with dope furniture and artwork. You can imagine my dismay when I realized I left my memory card in my laptop. Luckily I was able to snap a few shots of the room's art with my camera phone and a friend of mine had a camera on hand to take a picture of me (I don't love the look on my face but when someone is doing a favor you can't have photoshoot style do'overs, a'well). Inspired by the room, this post is a collage of the art and photo of me... Photo of me: Yoli Daniels Currently Coveting </section>

So, today was the very first day I needed a winter accessory and though I probably love to accessorize more than any one normal person should, this made me a little sad. It was a beautiful fall day in NYC and though sunny, the wind was a bit out of control. Last time I was in Philly visiting the fam I snagged this gray and yellow knit hat complete with adorable ball and took it out for a test run today. Had brunch at Yatanga in Harlem (must try, very cool space!)My hat...really quite warm and cozy (<span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Nordstrom</span>).

My costume was challenging because the party I went to is one where you dance, a lot...so being comfortable and having a non-cumbersome costume that won't fall apart when you twirl around 100 times in a row is key. Here's what I wore: Layered tank/sleeveless cardigan, tights that lace up the sides, and my <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Tess</span> by <span class="found null tooltipped" data-tooltip="similar word: unknown<br/>cosine: null" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-dict-word="null" data-cosine="null">Barefoot Tess</span> "Japanese" boots. Added to that are kitty ears, a bell around my neck which I pulled off a studded collar and put onto a leather choker, fingerless faux leather studded gloves and of course no Bad Kitty is completed without a pink and black whip. I of course did a terrible job at remember to take pics before the party and sweaty post dancing makeup madness. But here's a little something. I'll do better next time, PROMISE!
