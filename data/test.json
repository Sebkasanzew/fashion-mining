Five Days with   Fleur du Mal  was an instagram blast of their latest lovely leather bra.  Each day there was a post on different outfits wearing the leather bra. The quality of all the brands pieces are amazing and comfortable.  Fleur du Mal is fun, flirty, a little dirty and so sexy!

HYPEBEAST.COM Interview was an interview to voice my opinion and answer questions about women in street wear and fashion trends amidst the digital generation.  This interview was unlike any interview I've done before.  It hit close to heart as being a women in the street wear world is still new and improving.  Women are making their mark everyday whether it's in or out of the street wear culture, and everyones contribution counts.  The digital generation is also new and the pros and cons of the internet bring up so many questions about where will this all go... are we moving too fast? Can we keep up? So many questions!!! \nAleali May for Hypebeast  \n2.

Not only are they interested in making better cars, they're interested in the consumer!  \n Aleali for #PaidMyDues  \n1.  ALEALIMAY the site.  This has been the best accomplishment of 2014 for me, as I launched this site a couple months ago.  It took so long to actually put this into fruition but we're here!  Without photographer @AllbyAllen and many others that contributed to this site, it wouldn't showcase my vision as great it does.  On here I showcase events I attend, places I go, my experiences and outfits.  I mean, no need to write too much on what blog is about... cause I've placed it in the ABOUT section (HA!).  Thank you again for everyones support and tuning in every week.

It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive.  Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history.  There are also monumental canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings.  Art on the island of Gorée is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac! This was one of my best days spent in Dakar, Senegal.  I could never forget this day.\nDAY 3: CHEZ SALIM - LAC ROSE \u0026 The Seed Project's Culture Night\nLac Rose, also known as the Pink Lake, was once a lake filled with fish.  Later, the fish ended up disappearing one by one and the lake produced salt.  With the position of the sun and also the salt, the lake can give off the same effect of pink lemonade (but not as delightful if you drink it).  Men and women gather buckets and boats of salt and divide them into sections on the shore.  Most of the salt is exported and used in cities that need salt for the ground, to disintegrate the ice on the sidewalks.  We visited the nearby villages, sand dunes and the beach.  This whole journey was brought to us by four wheelers and a tour guide.  Crops of mint and turnips grew in between villages, with even a fresh water supply dug from the ground.  After the festivities, we ate on the shores local restaurant and later attended culture night at The Seed Academy.\nDAY 4 \u0026 5:  THE SEED ACADEMY \nThe Seed Academy is a non profit organization that runs an academy for young boys and girls.  They use basketball and education as their platform to prepare opportunities in Senegal.  With both education and talent, kids are prone to opportunities outside of Africa with scholarships and many more benefits.  The days spent with the Seed Academy were amazing.  The kids had been working hard and playing against each other all season in basketball games called the Hoop Forum.  For lunch that day, we had a traditional Senegalese meal with local drinks of ginger, chicken and sautéed onion, and rice.  The last day held the final game at the Marius Ndiaye Stadium.  East won vs. West as NBA players Wilson Chandler of the Denver Nuggets and Gorgui Dieng of the Minnesota Timberwolves helped coach both sides.  The Seed Academy showed so much love and were great hosts during my stay in Senegal.  This isn't a farewell message, 'cause I'll be back!\n"}

How you may ask? I was on Saks.com plucking pictures of things I fancy when I noticed all of the clothing was from the same designer. There's a brand I love called t-bags...I have a few dresses that I scored from Off Saks this summer (see picture below). The Los Angeles based brand is a straight size brand who does plus sizes for select retailers including Saks and Saks.com. The pieces are a little pricey but totally worth it, the quality, the details down to the hangtags are perfection. I'm completely obsessed with the pieces below and pretty much want everything. I'm going to stalk Off Saks until a few of them pop up (you know I hate paying retail for anything, it's against my religion).

Anyhoo, I'll try to work in OOTD posts here and there but right now my wardrobe consists of easy to pull on sweats and that's hardly interesting. So, back to businesss!\nCity Chic launched in the US a few months ago and I must admit, I was sort of excited. They had these titillating emails with a count down clock enticing me to check back with the website as they delayed the launch for a few weeks. When it finally went live my first response was...\"seriously?\" A hand full of \"eh\" pieces that were a little to juniors department for my taste.\nFast forward to a few days ago: I went onto CityChicOnline.com and thought, hmmm...now we are talking! It reads to me like a hybrid of Torrid and Asos. There is still a fair amount of \"eh\" but there are also some pretty stand out pieces that don't look like stuff you can find anywhere and really are CHIC. Below are a few of my favs:\nThe above Mesh Studded Skater Top is my favorite thing on the site. The kimono style top has mesh inserts on the shoulders and back and looks effortlessly cool. I love easy tops that are comfy but have dope details that add interest. This will be MINE, oh yes...it will be mine!\nThe So Cute Contrast dress (blk/coral) is really \"so cute\" but looks like a few things I already own so I don't feel like I'm dying to have it but it's adorable and worth featuring. To be honest if the black bodice where white it'd be a little more edgy and more of something I want to own. The Caltlyn Maxi dress is great. Something I'd want to wear to a pool party with embellished flats. And lastly the Zip Front Dress has a fantastic geometric print and is great for now with tights and leather or summer with sandals. *Thumbs UP*\nThese Self Tie Cargo slacks seem sooooo versatile! Pair them with a slouchy jersey top, a sexy tuxedo blazer or even this Silver Lace Top. I forever love denim but trousers are the new sexy. Pumps, Chuck Taylors, Flip Flops...Hotness.\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

Not a huge selection but some really cute pieces that aren't your run of the mill thing.\nI knew I wanted to do a post about the site as I hadn't heard of it so I figured a few others might not have either but I also wanted to address mixing patterns since so many gals emailed me about it. Below are a few looks that when scrolling through the site, you might not think to put together but the key to mixing patterns is that they should complement each other not compete.\nMy favorite thing about Missphit is that most everything is under $50.

Anna and her sales team were in the city for sales and press appointments at the AKA Hotel penthouse in midtown.\nWhen I arrived I took a quick look at the collection and was instantly attracted to the color stories. Anna Scholz is known for saturated color and prints on sumptuous fabrics, which generally I find near missing in most other plus size collections.\nAnna walked me through the collection and then we had a chat: We spoke about how it all started. Anna began sewing very early on in life. As a six foot tall size 14 teenager, making clothes happened really out of necessity. She would receive fabrics and tools for presents or instead of shopping trips; which I find completely cool.\nWhile Anna doesn't name her collections or work from a specific \"theme\", fall 2011 certainly feels inspired. It's a well rounded collection of dresses, tops, trousers and fabulous coats. Having seen quite a bit of luxe 70's inspiration on the runways this past fashion week, the collection definitely touched on the trend. Many of the pieces reminded me of what a reformed 70's rocker chick would wear. I say reformed because the clothes are polished and are bound to make you look really put together so, she'd be well beyond the drunken mess phase of life.\nI'm obsessed with the leopard, vintage bird and geometric prints shown above! Anna and I discussed how so many plus women want to fade into the background and shy away from bold colors and especially prints but her love of the audacious has really set her apart and has been the foundation of a very loyal customer base. I certainly don't believe in hidding and don't want to be invisible.\nWhat was great about these clothes is that even though it gave a nod to the 70's trend everything was also really modern. The fringe shown above gives so much life to this LBD and just when you thought you didn't love lace (which I absolutely do!), here comes a lace motorcylce jacket with edgy zipper details that you didn't even know you needed! Over all I LOVE this collection and want nearly all of it. Below are a few pictures of what's available at AnnaScholz.com for spring/summer.

Amongst them...Indashio's FW11 Show.\nIf you haven't heard of him, you soon will. Indashio is a stylist, TV Personality and genuinely one of the nicest people in fashion. We met a few years back when I was putting together the Nolcha Fashion Week Shows and his over the top FUN personality won me over instantly. He's dressed Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton, Amber Rose and many others.\nAnyhoo...I went down to the show early to check out the Style360 set up at the Metropolitan Pavilion and get some back stage scoop and shots. As I'm waiting on line (they aren't letting press in yet), Indashio strolls up to the door in a trench coat that made him look like he either had a lots of acid in his pockets or a bunch of skittles...or both! (Taste the rainbow - mmm).\nHe sees me standing on the line, gives a warm hug and yells at security to \"Let Kellie in, she's cold!\". Skipping the line was def great as I was wearing a leather jacket and was in fact FREEZING.\nThe collection is called \"GAUDY\" and it was just that in the best possible way. It was flashy and \"look at me\" and cool. Inspiration: Liberace and Trident's new gum Trident Vitality.\nNever without a cast of merry characters, this shows casting was really incredible. Johnny Wier, Aubrey O'Day, Keenya from cycle 4 of America's Next Top model...all added flavor on the runway. Front row included Denise Richards, Adrienne Ballion, Kat De Luna, and one of my biggest model crushes Omahyra Mota.\nP.S. love the thickness in some of the models! I'm not one of those gals that are against rail thin models, they serve a purpose but I think there should be a balance and there was plenty of hips in this show.\nOutfit details: Faux Leather/Knit mixed jacket: Vintage, Body Con dress: Torrid, Tights: INC., Boots: BlowFish, Necklace:Vintage, Python/Gold earrings:Wendy Nichol\nNOTE: I completely forgot I didn't snap full pics of myself until I got home so there's one so-so pic in my room.

I'm OBESSESED with Alexander Wang, Betsey Johnson and Charlotte Ronson. In brief: Alexander Wang is inspiring...period. Though his clothes don't come in plus sizes you can certainly recreate the vibe. Additionally his accessories are SICK *dead*. Betsey Johnson's show moved me for the first time in a very long time. It was rock and roll, chic, grown up, sexy all in one. She also has recently launched a less expensive line which is for \"every woman\" which is why she used her staff and sales force to model it rather than traditional \"models\". Lastly Charlotte Ronson *swoon* really fantastic and she has a doper than dope less expensive line at JCPenney, most of which is cut pretty generously. I have a few pieces from that collection and always get great feedback.\nSecond, I've added a \"Shop\" section where I'll sell new and gently used items I've acquired. The first thing up for grabs is an incredibly cool NOOKA watch. I got it in a fabulous over the top gift bag and never wore it. I have 2 and wear the camel colored one on rare occasions but the fuchsia not so much.\nNext, there's a new \"Beauty Buzz\" section where I'll do short to the point reviews on new or new to me products that are worth mentioning.\nAnd lastly, also new is the following OOTD. I've had these shorts for a few weeks and was looking forward to a respectably mild day to don them. These are from Torrid and I instantly fell in love with the bold floral print and sassy cut. I wore this on an afternoon mini date followed by dinner with another friend.

I must admit I was completely exhausted from a long flight the night before and a busy afternoon day of, but I'm so glad that I decided to go. The party was great fun, the food was really good and it was the perfect opportunity to don my Beth Ditto denim skirt from Evans which I've had for a few months but am just now getting around to wearing.\nI've owned quite a few denim skirts in my day but this is by far my favorite. There are so many unexpected details and it's SO comfortable. Aside from the very cool zipper down the front, the skirt has a muted floral print, asymmetrical hemline and sweatshirt-esque ribbed waist band.

Z for Zenobia is a terribly fabulous uber luxe Canadian brand sold at better department stores i.e. Saks and Saks.com. The company gifted me this gorgeous blackberry colored coat which happened to arrive the day before my birthday this past December and I decided it was a timely birthday gift (hehe).\nThis winter has been BRUTAL and so I was waiting for a warmer day to wear it since it's not lined but, I missed the boat on those spring like days and ended up wearing it this past Monday which was insanely cold! It was surprisingly warm and I did dress in layers so it ended up being great.\nIf you aren't familiar with the brand Z for Zenobia is a very high end line of beautiful classic pieces with a twist. It's definitely investment shopping, pieces that are timeless and that you will have forever.\nThe coat gave me this very whimsical vibe, the over sized hood and a-line silhouette sort of made me want to dress up like a woodland nymph lol.\nI digress...Here is my first interpretation of how to wear it. I paired it with a blush colored maxi dress from Asos, a lace top (which you can't see here oh well) and added a belt since the pin closure that came with the jacket was allowing a bit more wind to pass through than wanted.\nDEETS: Coat:Z for Zenobia Dress:Asos Necklace:Gift from my bestie Belt:Torrid Boots:BlowFish\nHere are a couple of looks from currently available on Saks.com:\n"}

I'd been stalking Asos hoping it would reappear on the site and in different colors and FINALLY I spotted it. (EXCITED!) I bought both black and blue and wore them for some weekend chillation.\nWhy I love this dress:\n#1 It's really long, so if you are shorter than say, 5'8...you'd need super high heels.\n#2 The jersey is utterly fantastic and great quality.

Anyhoo...I wanted to post this as I've had the pics sitting on my computer for about a week. I took them last weekend when at my folks house. My style has been all over the place the last few weeks, some days I'm feeling monochromatic and the next moment mixing patterns, gold + silver and whatever else I feel like throwing on.\nThis was the first time I wore this Calvin Klein tee and it's definitely going to make it into my regular rotation. You can't really tell from the photos (really need a better camera) but the tee has gold shimmery thread throughout which really adds interest. So there you have it, just a casual weekend outfit.\nDEETS: Top-Calvin Klein, Jeans-Calvin Klein, Necklace-Nordstrom Rack, Ring-Avenue, Bracelet-Tiffany, Shoes-Moda Spana\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

I was looking forward to her new FOX show \"New Girl\" and it was actually pretty funny. Premise is, she's an odd ball chick who finds her boyfriend in bed with another girl and ends up finding three male roommates online to share an apt with. Within episode one they realize she's a bit of a maniac (watching \"Dirty Dancing\" five times a day, crying etc), get her out to get back on the dating horse, she's stood up...then they bond over rescuing her from the embarrassment of being stood up.\nAnyhoo Zoe is a style icon and rightfully so. Though her style isn't really the same as mine, I love her aesthetic and point of view as it relates to fashion. She marries whimsy and cool like no other. It's like June Cleaver is transplanted to the East Village in the late 70's smokes some weed and decided to add a thin patent belt and punky heels to her dresses. Or...something, ha. Asos has a bunch of very Zoe-esque fabness for under $100. Here it is.\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

Though I was leaning toward reading about the evenings madness on my Twitter timeline, one of my good friends is in town from Miami and I decided not to be anti-social. So we headed out.\nThe night began and ended with lots and lots of traffic. We were headed to a VEVO event, then noticed that we mistook the event address for the after party address after letting the cab go. We ended up having to walk to the event...grabbing a slice on the way (starving!)\nAs irony would have it after woofing down a slightly gross slice, we arrive at Vevo only to learn it's a sit down dinner with a pretty fabulous looking menu, Robin Thicke is to perform. Etc. Etc.\nInstead of wasting time at a dinner for which we weren't hungry, we left and joined the mayhem that was the Meat Packing District.\nHere's what I wore...easy, comfortable. What I loved most is my \"newish\" Rebecca Minkoff hot pink snake skin printed bag. Complete with delicious gold chain shoulder strap and hardware *swoon*. I say \"newish\" because I got it this summer and just started using it last week at a dinner with friends. You will be seeing this bag a lot, ob-sessed. I have another Rebecca Minkoff bag which I rarely wear I don't know what my problem is but I'm practicing a new habit of wearing my things not just staring at them prettily arranged in my closet.\nAnd so we ran around popping in and out of pop-ups and boutiques. A few standouts: The Tracy Reese store was hilarious. People \"booty dancing\" in the store windows, music blaring and inside, kind of like a bizarre nightclub. After surfing through the hair flailing and grinding couples, I spotted a really cute cape (see above) which made me smile (see above). Note: the chick on the blackberry is my friend Franny who...was getting her work/party combo on.\nAnother good time had was at Elizabeth Charles, a fab high-end boutique featuring all Australian designers. She was a client of mine about (mumble) years ago. I launched the original store location on Perry Street when she was bringing major brands like Sass \u0026 Bide to the US. So great to see her, stop by there if you want exclusive designer finds from the land of down under.\nWe ended up at Calypso and Catherine Malandrino...but CM was closed so sad, the party we actually went down there for. Still a good time, bumped into the lovely Lauren Ruotolo from Hearst and her boo snapped some cool pics for me, I hope to see them soon! The END- ha.\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

I want to do a better job at engaging and also I get so many sweet notes asking for more outfit posts so I'm really going to try. There are a few obstacles I'll have to overcome i.e. the days I don't wear more than my gym clothes and the days that I love what I'm wearing and there's no one around to snap a few flicks for me. But I will prevail...maybe haha.\nIf you read the blog regularly you know I love mixing luxe and less. And spending less is my fav! On a recent trip to my favorite time killing wander around spot (the Marshall's on 125th street) I found a few really great pieces. Traditionally I hate sweaters and then I bump into this amazing oversize boxy sweater from Calvin Klein and I thought, damn I might really love this! So after a quick trip to the dressing room to make sure - score it was mine. These jeans were also snagged that day, also Calvin Klein and they are SO comfortable.\nI've always loved how Calvin jeans fit me but they are always too short so I'd never get them, but now that all I seem to be wearing is ankle length jeans with a fold at the bottom anyway, I can go Calvin crazy. What I love most about them is that they have a little stretch but they don't loose shape after being in them all day. So...here goes the CK of it all.\nDeets: Sweater- Calvin Klein, Jeans- Calvin Klein, Shades- Gucci, Bag- Bliss Lau, Lips- Nars \"KINK\"\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

The event, hosted by Gabi Gregg of popular blog, GabiFresh , was held at the Cooper Union Hotel in Manhattan and honestly was a very pleasant surprise.\nBelow: Me, Gabi Gregg, Jodi Arnold - VP of Design at Limited and her lovely Assistant.\nThis is what I wore: The Deets are HERE\nWhat I took away from the event is that this is a brand that is genuinely interested in getting it right. Though the collection is mostly Career, there are sprinkles of separates that I would incorporate into my wardrobe.\nI liked pretty much everything but liking things and actually wanting to wear them are a little bit different for me. Eloquii's first collection is attractive, fashion forward and what I like most about it is that, for Career wear it's full of bright colors, snazzy patterns and spot on trend silhouettes.\nHere are three models from the launch event in a few of my favorite looks from the collection!\nThis is a look from the lookbook that I actually really loved. I'd definitely wear this top!\nThe site launches this coming Tuesday, so no matter if you're a career gal in a conservative office, like to punch up your work clothes with bright colors and fun pieces or more like myself which is much more bold in my choices, I think pretty much anyone could find something they like. Check out www.eloquii.com next week and let me know what you think!\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

But it's always great to go through your things each season, see what you love and want to keep, get rid of things you no longer love, then you can see what's missing/what you need to add and let the shopping begin. Here are a few things that caught my eye:\n1. I looooove slick shades. These cat eye black/brown sunglasses from Versace are on SunglassHut.com. Another great place to find designer shades on the cheap is Nordstrom Rack and Off Saks - rows upon rows of Fendi, Gucci, Marc Jacobs, Versace up to 60% off.\n2. I'm not just addicted to animal prints, I also love animal jewelry. I usually am drawn to snakes, tigers and elephants. Kenneth Jay Lane is one of my fav jewelry designers and this tiger cuff is EVERYTHING. ShopBop.com\n3. To say that I love leather would be an understatement, leather pants beyond mandatory for my fall wardrobe. Leather pants can be tricky in plus, I want them TIGHT and not cut like trousers so I opted for these leather leggings from OneStopPlus (Jessica London) - I've actually already received these in the mail and they are amazing, the front is leather and the back a nice thick knit fabric. They fit like leggings but don't have a lot of give so don't order a size down.\n4. I've gone just little crazy this season with leather jackets. The waterfall was huge last season and I'm not letting it go. Nordstrom.com for this one.\n5. Capes are EVERYWHERE, but don't just look to plus brands for a great cape. Obviously the sizing is quite big so look to other brands for a great cape. This one is incredible from Cynthia Steffe and I have to have it!! I'm annoyed that Bloomingdales only has sizes 0 and 4 left since I have a 25% coupon to shop online there. But Saks.com has it in sizes up to 12... which should fit perfectly.\n6. Colored pants are just great. I don't really have much more to say than...get yourself a great pair of colored pants! NOW! These are going to be great with all of my leather jackets, and animal prints. AsosCurve\n7. A cool bag that adds interest is a must. This as all of my previously mentioned obsessions rolled into one super cute bag. Rebecca Minkoff - Saks, Bloomies, ShopBop she's everywhere.\n8. Another magical jewelry moment from the one and only Alexis Bittar. He just gets me, that's why I GET so many of his pieces. AlexisBittar.com - great pieces, a little pricey but worthy investments!\n9. I just love this look. Prairie New York is a great contemporary plus brand you can find in better department stores, really great. Another trend I really find myself gravitating toward is Tuxedo inspired pieces and this Tuxedo Bib Dress looks effortlessly fab. Salon Z on Saks.com\n10. Personally I'm on a constant hunt for black wedge boots, stumbled across these on Revolve.com and the white insert on the heel coupled with the studs has my heart beating fast but I personally need a little more lift in the front for comfort. (Bad knee wackness) But I couldn't resist featuring them they are HOT.\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

It really reminds me of Philly (yep, I'm a Philly girl). I went to ReDress to drop off some wears and then to brunch with my peeps.\nThe funny thing is, I feel like white jeans don't even come to mind except for in fall. Obviously you know I don't really subscribe to conventional fashion rules. I wear what I want, when I want and that includes my thick ole' thighs in white pants.\nI've said it like 1,000 times but I looooove mixing neutrals. So here it is again...one of my favs - white, black and brown. I do fear that my obsession with ankle length pants is going to cause a few issues once the temperature drops to Siberiaesque temps. Ahh well. Cold ankles, cute pants...you can guess which road I'll take on that one.\nDEETS: Brown leather jacket - Vintage, Twisted knot tank - Avenue, White jeans - Michael Kors, Bag- Badgley Mischka, Boots - BlowFish, Nails - OPI/Pretty Edgy, Lips Nars/Kink\nCurrently Coveting\n"}

I could go on and on but honestly, I'm not really in the mood haha. I'll revisit some deeper thoughts on the subject - perhaps in a video.\nSpeaking of video, I did a fun little OOTD video for my new YouTube channel which I hope you all will subscribe to! I had a fantastic day with an equally fantastic partner in crime...complete with lounging, brunch, a movie, and way too many lattes. Here's a pict
