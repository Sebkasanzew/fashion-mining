Mixing it up with the occasional run along the west-side highway does a girl good. But one thing that I've learned is most important? Really getting in a good stretch before and after a workout. It completely leans you out, and elongates you. Plus, it feels really good. Stretching is just as serious as my activewear. I've just stocked up on new gear from Lord & Taylor. Calvin Klein Performance, along with Under Armor, to name a few of my favorite brands. I love a soft palette for the gym. Greys, blacks, and neutral tie-dyes, along with a stellar pair of kicks. I kicked off the new year fresh with a good yoga session on my front porch back in California. This year is all about being stronger, healthier, and a lot more zen.

Once in a while, usually on a long-haul flight, something will trigger a memory of pronouncing \"Niger\" incorrectly in Year 5 geography class, or a contact lens falling out in the middle of a speech in front of the whole school, and I'll spend the next three hours systematically working my way through every mortifying moment in my lifetime until I feel like the entire plane is judging me. Aside from that, I feel like I'm a pretty forward-thinking person. NO RAGRETS. And yet, my one genuine source of recurring regret is not having spent more time with my extended family in China. Growing up, we returned to the Motherland once every couple of years, which was certainly not often enough (nor did we stay long enough) to be treated as anything but disproportionately important guests. Asian sisters in the room (or any family-based culture, for that matter) you know how it is. Being force fed the home-cooking so good that you want to vomit, bruised cheeks from elderly pinching with bonus running commentary on how \"fat\" you are and don't forget the violent battle for the cheque at the end of a meal at a restaurant. Over the course of my travelling career, my body has associated particular sensory experiences with particular continents. In Europe, I feel like my chest is wide open, my breathing deepens and slows down, I'm constantly looking up in awe of the architectural history and I see colours in periodically relevant music (hot tip: walking around the white hills of Granada with Granados playing in your ears is the closest you'll ever be to any kind of bizarro enlightenment people claim to reach). Every Asian city I've worked in over the past four years has had a similar effect of stirring sensory memories I built between ages 7 and 16: the weird contrast between beautiful weathered old women with a tonne of corn attached to their bike and the youth's hyper-reliance on technology, the blur of sewerage and Arctic air-conditioning, the simultaneous mass obsession and rejection of Western culture and commerce. You definitely internalise to cope with the clockwork masses. And you definitely try not to breathe the smog and secondary cigarette smoke. A 48 hour work stint in Hong Kong last month (during which these shots and elaborate tripod selfies were taken more on that later) definitely reignited all of the above. The last time I was in China, I was hiking in \u56db\u5ddd, with numb toes from the December freeze, and a numb mouth from the famous provincial chillies I overzealously consumed with every meal. The time before that, this website didn't even exist, and Justin Bieber still had a bowl cut. Time to return to the Motherland. Beam me up.

        "extracted_text": "After my house is clean, my laundry done and my meals planned for the next week, I finally have the head space to think about how I want to improve myself for the next year. I like the idea of resolutions. Sure - we may not keep all of them, or any of them, but it's still nice to have some conscious goals to work towards in the name of self improvement. LISTENINGI'm trying a lot harder to do less talking about myself (when I'm nervous, it's easy to do) and instead hear more of what others are saying. Asking open ended questions \"how did you do that?\" or \"tell me more about that\" are helping me in this arena. I think I'm a pretty extroverted person, but I sometimes feel really awkward in social situations (read: nervous blabbering mentioned above). MAKE ME TIME COUNT (or less reality tv & mindless social media)Uhhh. I watch way too much TV, especially at night after Felix goes to bed. I'm usually in relaxation mode and don't want to work on the blog so it's easy to just plop onto the couch and turn on The Bachelor (ok ok ok, I'm still going to watch it, it's just reruns on E!, HGTV and The Food Network that I need to cool my jets on) I also think this would be a great time to get back into reading, something I admittedly haven't done at all since Felix was born. And like most people on the planet, I spend too much time on my phone which doesn't really increase my overall happiness more than anything I could be doing instead. I want to cut that addiction and really limit my facebook and instagram scrolling (I'll probably narrow them down as well). I think an alarm clock in the bedroom instead of having my phone in there will curb my scrolling time too. On that note, if there's ever something you absolutely want/need a personal answer for, email is the best way to reach me! TWO MINUTE RULEThis is one I mentioned yesterday and from last year's resolutions. When I'm on it, it really works. In short - if there's a task that can be completed in less than two minutes - do it now. And trust me - there are a lot of things that can be scratched off your list in that amount of time! Picking up toys, vacuuming, switching over the laundry, emptying the dishwasher, etc. Just carrying a load of whatever up or down the stairs on my way makes everything a little more settled. ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVEEliminate the negative. Embrace the affirmative. And don't mess with Mr. Inbetween. Happy New Year! ",

        "extracted_text": "Growing up and living in Los Angeles with hundreds of restaurants and food options just minutes away, eating out or delivery dinners were the norm, but since moving up to the mountains, where our choices have diminished, we actually use our kitchen and eat in nearly every day of the week now, which I love. The chillier winter months also keep us indoors more, and since our kitchen is part of our living room, or great room, it's always in view\u2026 which has its pros and cons. I love that everyone's always in the same space. I don't love that it's not entirely my dream kitchen and there are so many things I'd like to change which I notice every time I'm in the space. So I've partnered with the NEW Signature Kitchen Suite to get a start on making my dream kitchen come to life one appliance at a time. This is my kitchen\u2026 And while I've really made it work with our space, decoratively speaking, it's nowhere near my dream kitchen, though I feel wildly lucky to have such a large and open space to cook in and to share with friends and family, because it's the kitchen where we always end up, and I love that. But let me just start by saying that every single major appliance in my kitchen is made by a different brand. None match. NOT. A. ONE. And let me also just say that it kind of DRIVES ME INSANE. But what really gets my blood boiling yes, I know, dramatic, but you type A's will understand is that all of the appliances are stainless steal\u2026 all of them EXCEPT THE BUILT IN DOUBLE OVEN\u2026 which is black. Why? Who Does this? It's clear that the kitchen was renovated before we bought the house, so you'd think that all the appliances would match. But no. And while I do actually LOVE the layout of the kitchen, I'd REALLY LOVE to renovate it one day so that I could call it my own\u2026 because the potential for it to be my dream kitchen is so close \u2014 but OH so far away. But before a total renovation is necessary, I think there is one simple thing that could make me happy with my kitchen, and that is swapping out the current, mismatched oven for this DREAMY Signature Kitchen Suite Double Wall Oven because IT. IS. PERFECT. Just look at how beautiful it is\u2026 and how it would really finish my kitchen so nicely. I'm telling you, I've never wanted a kitchen appliance more than I want this double oven in that wall of my house. It even has Smart Functionality Through Wi-Fi connectivity with SmartThinQ\u2122, so you can stay in touch with it through a mobile device. At the push of a button, you can preheat appliances remotely, ensure ovens are turned off, receive push notifications if any issues arise, and even report errors straight to the industry leading personal Kitchen Concierge\u2122. I mean, how amazing is that? This beautiful masterpiece of an oven is part of the NEW Signature Kitchen Suite brand that was just launched at the Kitchen, Bath and Industry Show (KBIS) in Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 19, 2016, and every super-premium appliance in the suite from dishwasher to refrigerator to microwave, is stunning. At the show, three experts designed three personalized kitchen vignettes in what they call The Signature Style House. The creativity and passion that each expert brought to their kitchen design, paired with the elegant design and advanced technology of the Signature Kitchen Suite appliances, created a space and experience that was truly unique and unforgettable. Bosworth and Ambrose were also on-site to reveal their individual Signature Kitchen Suites, and chat with attendees about what they created. The event also included a live demo from an award-winning celebrity chef, Marcus Samuelsson. It sounds like it was amazing!

(Photo by Bizuayehu Tesfaye/AP Images for Signature Kitchen Suite) Would I swap nearly every appliance in my kitchen for Signature Kitchen Suite so that they all matched perfectly giving my kitchen a luxurious, custom look? Ab-so-lutely. Yes. 100% The sleek dishwasher, with its LoDecibel\u2122 Quiet Operation and TurboWash\u2122 technology would be next on my list of upgrades because not only is the latch on mine broken, it takes FOREVER and is RIDICULOUSLY LOUD too. This Signature Suite dishwasher enables more powerful washing and cycles that take less time to complete running at only 40 decibels. Faster AND quieter? Yes. Please. But honestly, I would be jumping for joy to simply replace the one very mismatched double wall oven for the sleek new Signature Kitchen Suite Double Wall Oven because it would make me and my kitchen complete\u2026 for now anyway. I mean\u2026 It's perfect. And I need it. What one thing would make your kitchen so much better?

        "extracted_text": "I've been promising to do an updated beauty routine post for a while\u2026here it is! It's always so hard to condense a beauty post. I'm a beauty junkie, so I'm sorry in advance if this runs long! Not all of the products I'm going to mention are pictured (some of my more well-loved makeup is too far gone to photograph) but I will include links to all. I'll do a night time routine soon as well! SKINCARE: Every morning I wash my face using a gritty washcloth with Fresh Soy Cleanser. Then I apply Dear By Tone Up Booskin toner with a cotton pad, and follow up by massaging a few drops of Hylamide Glow Serum into my face. This serum builds up a very subtle natural glow in your skin. I get pasty in the winter, so I love how this brings the life back to my complexion. If I have time in the morning, I like to do a Korean sheet mask before I get ready. Before I begin my makeup, I completely saturate my skinwith moisture by using a lot of face cream. Right now I love Dr. Jart's Cermadin cream. It makes a great base for makeup and protects my skin when we are out shooting on freezing cold mornings! For SPF, I've been using MISSHA's waterproof sun milk for years now. It is very light and non-greasy. If I am having a breakout, I apply this acne serum to help clear it up faster. PRIMER: I always start my makeup with Bare Minerals Skin Revver-Upper. It has glycolic and salicylic acid in it that plump up your skin instantly. I must warn you, it smells a little weird! If I have a long day of shooting ahead, I will also use Hourglass's Mineral Veil Primer. This makes your makeup waterproof, so it has major lasting power, even through rain or working out. FOUNDATION: I use a few foundations on a rotating basis, but here are my favorites. My current favorite is CoverFx's Custom Cover Drops. This is a concentrated foundation serum that is meant to be mixed with skin care. As a skin care freak, this is a dream come true! I mix mine with a drop of a honey skin oil and apply it with a stippling brush. Mixed with oil, this gives the dewiest skin ever. Huge fan of this! I also use Bare Minerals broad spectrum foundation in Fair very regularly. I've been using Bare Minerals since I was 13, I'm still in love with it! It photographs beautifully up close and its never cakey. If I have any sort of breakout going on, this is the foundation I'm using. CONCEALER, BRONZER, AND LUMINZER: I've recently discovered Benefit's Erase Paste\u2026best under eye concealer ever! It's a salmon tinted concealer to color-correct under eye circles. It is very emollient and goopy, so a little goes a long way. I love the look of super glowy skin, and as I recently mentioned on Instagram, BECCA cosmetic's Shimmering Skin Perfector Poured is insane! I put this on underneath my foundation because the glow is pretty intense. I use the color Moonstone. I like to bronze up my temples and the hollows of my cheeks with Becca's Lowlight/Highlight pallette. Even on someone as pale as me, this looks very natural and subtle. EYES AND BROWS: I use mostly cream eyeshadows, and ever since I bought Charlotte Tilbury's Eyes to Mesmerize cream shadow I am hooked. I love the shades Jean and Marie Antoinette, I use them every day as a base for whatever eyeshadow I'm doing. The four-quad eyeshadow palette pictured above is Charlotte Tilbury's Vintage Vamp palette. I love a rose smokey eye. I am obsessed with Marc Jacob's Velvet Noir mascara right now. One coat gets me where I want my eyelashes to be. It is also intensely black in color. I don't usually wear false eyelashes but I hoard them in my makeup bag for some strange reason. The ones pictured here are super cheap and amazing from Liftly. I just found my holy grail brow product in Dior's Brow Styler Ultra Fine Precision Pencil. This pencil is so incredibly fine! It makes every stroke look like real brow hairs. I have tried everything for eyebrows, and this is my favorite. LIPS AND CHEEKS: I only own a few lipsticks because I am pretty picky about them. One I always use is Chanel's Rouge Coco in 418 Misia. This is one of those colors that would suit anyone! I never apply from the tube, I tap it on as a sheer stain with my fingers. Favorite lipstick ever. I also recently ordered LadyKin's One Touch Bling Glow Lipstick in Fall Rose and fell in love with the color and formula. It's also only six dollars, so that's a bonus. I never wear just one shade of blush\u2026I usually mix about three and put them in different places around my temples and cheeks. I'm obsessed with Narsissist Cheek Studio for this reason! The colors are to die for! Also obsessed with Becca's Beach Tint Shimmer Souffle in Guava. This is the perfect natural flush/skin luminizer. Above are a few recent acquisitions worth mentioning that I've added to my say time skin routine\u2026.

We don't, so we thought about all the products we love and can fit in our gym bag to use before and after our workout. Some of them are real game changers! BEFORE The secret to feeling comfortable is to arrive prepared. To do that, you just need a few specific products: deodorant, dry shampoo (to prevent hair from sticking too much after the workout) and sunscreen if you are outdoors (yes, even in the winter). The true highlight to add to the selection is a gel to prepare the muscles: trust us, you will thank us later. Don't forget to take your makeup off, skin tends to get irritated when you sweat during a workout and some makeup components might alter, changing their color. AFTER To recover from your exercize, pamper yourself. If you shower at the gym, choose a shower gel with an energizing fragrance or a toning body scrub. If, instead, you prefer to relax, the best choice would be a warm bath with salts and essential oils, which are also very nourishing. Once you get out of the bathtub, accurately dab your skin and, then, move to the toning phase! The latest products on the market will help you extend the beneficial effects of the workout even out of the gym. For an ultra-quick absorption, that will guarantee undamaged clothes, we suggest light oil formulas. In our gallery you'll find our favorite ones.

I took a little break from the blog over Christmas to spend some time with my family, stock up on inspiration and finish decorating my apartment. So, today I thought I'd share a little sneak peek of my dining area, or more importantly, my new gorgeous chairs! I have dreamt about these Fritz Hansen chairs for ages and when we bought our new apartment, they were the first thing I ordered. The delivery time for these beauties was quite long (about 8 weeks) but let me tell you, they were well worth the wait. I went back and forth with the color choice but finally decided to mix it up a bit and ordered them in white, black and grey and I absolutely love the result! Mixing chairs is a fun & easy way to spice up your dining area, but to pull it off, consistency is key. Always make sure the chairs have one element in common shape, hue or material. If you're mixing chairs with completely different shapes, stick to one color or material to keep the look harmonious. Or, do like me and go for chairs in the same style but pick a different color for each chair to add some drama! CHAIRS Fritz Hansen \u2018Grand Prix' / Nordiska Galleriet.

I've been travelling for the last few weeks from New York to California with my friend and photographer Nicole. We spent one weekend in New York before flying to LA, San Fran and now road tripping down Highway 1 along the beautiful Big Sur. This is just a quick update from my favourite season and place, Fall in NYC. How to get there: I flew with Cathay Pacific from Sydney to New York JFK, via Hong Kong. It is one of the longest flights possible (making the most of sleep!) and I prefer not having to stopover in LA for customs and baggage. Where to stay: I stayed downtown NYC in TriBeCa for the first time, at the Smyth, A Thompson Hotel. Their suite was one of the biggest spaces I've experienced in NYC, with an incredible vine covered terrace with views. Where to eat: Jack's Wife Freda has always been a favourite of mine. They recently opened a location on Carmine Street in the West Village as well as their original spot on Lafayette in Soho. My favourites on the menu are Maya's Grain Bowl, the Rosewater Waffles and Nana tea. The Butcher's Daughter on Kenmare Street is known for a delicious, and mostly vegan menu that always helps in my jet lag recovery. I always get the Red Juice and Spicy Kale Caesar Salad. The Momofuku Ramen from Momofuku Noodle Bar is my favourite dish in the world. I often joke that I could eat Ramen all day every day, especially for breakfast\u2026 so you can imagine how many different Ramen's I've tried the world over. Make sure to get there early as there can be a long line. Try the pork buns too! What to see and do: Central Park is definitely the most beautiful during Fall. The leaves change colour seemingly overnight after a cold snap, and transform the park in to a multicoloured wonderland. I get a picnic lunch from Whole Foods at Columbus Circle and sit on the hill above the Duck Pond, overlooking the trees and city. Make the most of the Brooklyn Flea Markets over the weekend before the weather gets too cold. Wander with a hot apple cider, and if it isn't too windy take the ferry down the East River back to Manhattan. Photos by Nicole Cooper",

I mean, seriously, shy should only kids enjoy the colorful and happy world of Disney. One is only as old as one feel , isn't it?I think in general, we deal too much about what people think about us in person and how we act or what we wear, even we set a lot of pressure on ourselves for no obvious reason.When I saw this lovely grey sweater with the pink Minnie mouse on the front side, I knew this one was made for me. I couldn't wait for the next day to try it and of course to share it with you. As I think, this look doesn't look childish or strange at all and I really like this style on me and that is and should always be the only thing that matters.I think Vans did a great job by including Disney in the collection and also the pieces for next season, which I already had a preview at during the German press days, is going to be something.

        "extracted_text": "Maxie's posts is spot on today. One of the hardest things that I had to figure out when I quit the rowing team in college was what my morning routine would be. For years I had been waking up extra early to rush to get to school (that 7:25am start always felt terrible) or rushing out the door before the crack of dawn to get to practice. Once I quit though, I had luxurious mornings to fill up. Even my earliest class at 8:50am felt incredibly late. The first few weeks I slept in, but I'd find myself groggy. Then I started to work in a morning routine and it changed how my entire day went. With my first job in NYC, I had a strict morning routine that really set how my whole day would go. I needed that rhythm to get me going! Even working from home, I stick to a routine. I swear by it!How to Create a Morning Routine You Stick to in 2016Guest post by Maxie McCoyThe way you start your day sets the entire tone of the day. Think about all the days you've snoozed seventy times only to rush around like a mad person. Or the countless mornings you've laid scrolling in bed, waist deep in facebook and Instagram and emails and snaps and texts. Thirty minutes later you're almost late for class or work and didn't have time to fuel your body. I know. Been there. So guilty. That used to be so me. And then a few years ago I got the wild idea to stop pushing emails right to my phone so that I didn't have to see everything waiting for me from the time I turned my alarm off. Or in the middle of the night when I woke up for some reason. It was an amazing change because I finally was able to erase my morning anxiety. My chest didn't tighten within 5 minutes of waking up. This year, I've upped my morning game by creating an entire morning routine that doesn't include my phone. No emails. No social. No texts. No calls. Pings. Mentions. Comments. Surfing. Double taps. Or scrolling. It's almost a full hour digital detox each morning like this one so that I can make breakfast, meditate and get ready before diving into the digital world. It's slow, peaceful, and all mine.And it's hard. It's tremendously hard to turn my alarm off while seeing some of the notifications on my homescreen and not want to check everything and just get right into it. I'm tempted to scroll through facebook and twitter while I'm drinking my tea. And I occasionally wonder if there's anything significant going on that needs my attention. There's not. There never has been. From taking emails off my phone a few years ago to this new prolonged morning ritual without my phone, not a single problem has arisen that couldn't be taken care of post routine. And more than that, it changes the entire feeling of my day.If it sounds nice, it's because it is. And it's probably the best gift you can give yourself. If your morning routine needs a little overhaul, here's some places to start:Ask Yourself How You Want to FeelOne of my soul sisters mentioned this idea to me last week when explaining how to come up with the right ritual for you ask yourself: \"how do I want my morning to feel?\" If it's currently crazed and you want to feel calm, add one thing into your morning that is soft and slow like hot tea on the couch or a stretch sequence by the bed. If you need to pump some strong energy into your day, try a 10 minute workout plan before hopping into the shower. Your morning sets your tone so figure out what you need each day.Move Your PhoneJust do it. Move it away from your bed. I know it's not the only outlet in your place. Move it so that you're not scrolling until midnight and facebook before you're even out of bed in the morning. And when you get to your morning musts, leave it where it is. The best way to combat the temptation of your phone (and it is actually an addiction) is to not have to fight it. If it's upstairs or in another room while you're doing your morning thing, you'll have so much more space to just be, breathe, and prepare. Start SmallI didn't get to a full hour of a calm morning of soulful preparation for my day off the bat. It started with no emails and has moved to what it is. And some days are a bit speedier than others depending on my schedule. When it comes to your golden morning routine that you can keep up, start small - even just ten minutes - and build onto it.No matter where you begin when it comes to building a morning routine you love, start somewhere. It'll have such a beautiful impact on your day that you'll do whatever you can to protect that special time and stick to it.For more tips to feed your soul, follow Maxie's writing!xoxo",

It's funny, when you visit a place fairly regularly - you get into a routine. You stay at the same hotels, eat at the same places. Often, I can spend my entire 2-3 days in a square mile radius! This trip, I knew I wanted a different experience. I'd venture out and stay at a hotel I've never been to and go for more of that home away from home feeling. I'd heard great things about Pali House - there's one in West Hollywood (where I stayed) and one in Santa Monica - so I figured I'd give it a try. I love boutique hotels with a bit of whimsey. The first photo is the view walking into the door. I was greeted by a very friendly front desk clerk who took my luggage down the stairs. Check it was easy and the elevator to the rooms are through this charming courtyard restaurant. I stayed in the Studio Residence which is basically a studio loft apartment that most New Yorkers would kill for. It's spacious, open and has a full kitchen. I didn't do any cooking in the three days I was here but the full size fridge was fab to have since I had guests over one day. The large marble bathroom is gorgeous - a little dark so no photos sorry! You can check out the open floor plan here. Quite a large room and the sectional sofa can double as a spare bed. The glass door leads to patio, featured below. All in all a terrific hotel I would definitely stay again.

Dallas has been hit with the most wonderful fall weather. It just feels so great to be able to breath outside again and to be able to wear clothes and not start pouring down in perspiration. Last week, I celebrated the fall like weather with bringing out a highlighted trend of this season...a little houndstooth.  This is print that never really goes out of style, but it can be seen highlighted in a variety of collections this fall. This, I think is a dress (which I have worn it as), but can also double for a nice fall jacket. I paired this with a high waist skirt from David's Bridal. You have seen me wear this a million times...lol. A shirt that I bought last season from Target, and the necklace came from H&M. The shoes are a patent and suede leather combo from Nordstrom.  The dress/jacket came from Stylish Consignments in Atlanta. The piece originally came from Shabby Apple. Their prices range from $89 - $160. I am a little ho hum on them though.  I actually won a piece from them on a blog. Although the jacket it cute, the button holes are unraveling and the button are cheap (one of them broke). I was thinking maybe because I bought this second hand, but no. The clothes just feel a little cheap in general. The piece that I won was cute. I really do like their design aesthetic. I just had similar issues with the dress that I won. Button holes unraveling, cheap buttons, and the fabric...well lets just say if you throw it in the washing machine its over for that garment.  Over all, for Shabby Apple, cute clothes, but cheaply made. I haven't actually bought a piece, but if I were I would be okay paying $89 for a piece, but I definitely would not pay $160. They seem to clearance some pieces for around $50 and honestly thats what I feel the clothes are worth...around $50.  I am really loving the attention that houndstooth is getting this season and I hope to add a few more pieces. Here are some of my other picks of fun ways to incorporate this print into your wardrobe.",

One of my favorite and most comfortable summer time looks is pairing a lightweight summer dress with nylon leggings, what's even better is I got them are amazing prices at Ross Dress for Less . The dress was $12, the hat was $11, the bag was $40, and the necklace was $17, totaling $80! I also love this look because it allows me to be shapewear free, which is super important in the summer, and it also allows me to wear dresses that are shorter. I've never been a fan of my legs, but it always seems like the cute dress are too short for my comfort zone. I paired the dress with leggings and I'm cute and in my comfort zone. Win!

Their outdoor patio has the right amount of greenery and potted bushes around it to enclose the space and the ambiance inside is unbeatable. A large wrap around, alderwood bar, a magazine news stand flanking the back (loaded with lots of foreign magazine goodness), an entire staff whose accents lilt with that certain French je ne sais quoi, and loads of little dimly lit corners, perfect for tucking away and enjoying some close conversation over wine.

Here are some pics I snapped with my iPhone while I was on the taxi, Paris is so magical!!! I will also be updating all my adventures LIVE from Paris on HYPEED's Facebook page, so make sure you are following it so you don't miss all the action! And before I go, I have to share something that happened yesterday; While I was on the train on my way here, I spotted a young couple sitting waiting for the train to arrive, they must have been around 17 years old and it was so sad yet romantic to see them say goodbye. The girl was getting on the train, with a small suitcase, her boyfriend was crying uncontrollably, yet he was making sure he was discreet, but you could see the sadness in his eyes, they were bright red and so was his face\u2026They kept hugging so tight, kissing and saying I love you while both were having tears falling down their cheeks\u2026 I know it was non of my business to look, but I just felt so moved by this scenario, because this exact same thing happened to me almost 9 years ago, but for me, that was the very last time I saw him \u2026 Young love. \u2026\"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\"\u2026 \u2665",

        "extracted_text": "Desks of Friends My desk is my home inside my home . I spend a lot of my time sitting at my desk writing mostly, and I have to be 100% comfortable. It's actually the smallest nook that actually has some sort of use. I kind of love that little nook. It's safe and cozy and I get my best work done there. Now... as much as I love my own desk, I'm actually fascinated with other people's. But, to be frank, I'm not interested in overly stylized, non-functional desks that you see in catalogs and magazines (and, well, Pinterest). I want to see where people actually work. I asked four of my friends ( Inslee , Alison , Katie , and Fred ) in completely different industries to share their desks. I think there's something really personal about each desk, and for that, I'm so thankful they were open enough to give us all a peek! Inslee Haynes ' Tips for Staying Organized 1. Plan a time to answer email and stick to it. Don't let email control your day by replying every time something comes in our you'll be tied to your inbox until midnight without doing any real work. 2. Clean up at the end of every day so you can start each new day with a clear head and a clear workspace. 3. Know when to quit. Trying to cram too many things into one day is the fastest way I get disorganized so I always plan a time to stop each day and try to stick to it (baring an illustration emergency, believe it or not, they exist). Why it's my favorite motivational quote: There are a few things that I repeatedly tell myself to calm down and stay focused. My favorite of which is \"this too shall pass\" which I learned in a yoga class at a moment when half the class was giving up and collapsing onto their mats. The teacher shouted that out to us and it totally saved me. I say this to myself all the time and it sets everything in perspective... Dealing with a tough client - this too shall pass.... Feeling like I can't get my whole to do list accomplished - this too shall pass... Getting an amazing new client or opportunity - savor this moment carefully because, yep, this too shall pass! ( Inslee.net ) Alison 's Tips for Staying Organized 1. Though I also have a MacBook Pro, I do much of my design and planning on this desktop. I love to listen to music while I work, but my only requirement is that I know the lyrics. (If I don't, I will be paying more attention to learning those than on my work!) Gus and Mr. Pinky, our cats, are my steadfast office companions! 2. I am an office supply nut and long-time lover of Black n' Red notebooks. I could spend hours in Staples or a stationery store. I write exclusively in black ink (I hate blue ink--I don't know why!). I prefer to use pencils in my planner, so I don't have to cross something out. (I would much rather erase!) I believe in function over fad, meaning I don't always rush out for the latest and greatest supplies. I stick to what works for me--even if that is simply printer paper on a clipboard. Story behind my desk: I purchased this desk from Target four weeks after I graduated from Georgetown in 2007. It was my first \"big girl\" furniture purchase--made completely on my own without help from my folks. Truth be told, it worked beautifully in my shiny and new DC apartment, but it doesn't quite fit the aesthetic of our loft in Providence. Since we'll be building our first home soon, my husband and I have held off buying any new furniture so that we can outfit it to the nines. I have bold plans for what that desk will look like, but for now, this beauty works just fine.  ( LongDistanceLoving.net ) Katie Rudder 's Tips for Staying Organized 1. Invest in a calendar and agenda. Keep them as organized and as up to date as possible! 2. Quote books can help you remain motivated. It's how I de-stress and remember sayings and quotes I like. I write in it only with specific markers to keep it looking similar and flip through it depending on my mood! Story behind my desk: I bought my desk from Walmart actually, which most people would never believe! I moved into my house and was forced to buy a few major pieces of furniture since our house was only partially furnished. Realizing quickly I would not be able to survive a summer, let along a school year, without a desk I started hunting. About a week later a big, bevy box arrived on my doorstep. Putting together a piece of furniture on your own is hard. Not only were the directions unclear, but my desk is different than most--it's a corner desk so everything is shaped funny and oriented differently. I ended up putting it together wrong at times but forged through to finally see the project happily end. With only minor damages when all was said and done, it's proudly finished and well equipped in my room. It's study and blogging HQ and also serves as a place to hold clothes (sorry Mom!). Decked out in pink and green, I don't think I would have it any other way! Fred Castleberry 's Tips for Staying Organized 1. Drop the OCD routine and cut yourself some slack 2. Give everything a \"place\" 3. Don't procrastinate in putting said object back in that \"place\" My favorite motivational quotation in its entirety: \"I think everything in life is art. What you do. How you dress, how you love someone, and how you talk. Your smile and your personality. What you believe in, and all your dreams. The way you drink your tea. How you decorate your home. Or party. Your grocery list. The food you make. How your writing looks. And the way you feel. Life is art.\" \u2014Anonymous ( UnabashedlyPrep.com ) I want to see your desks too! You can tweet/Instagram a picture (tag me so I can see @collegeprepster).

        "extracted_text": "I didn't think that last weekend could be beat , but this weekend was one for the record books. I took a little break in the afternoon on Friday to meet with Garrett and his friend; macaroni and cheese from The Smith is the best cure for rainy day blues. It was so gross outside really that I ducked into Bloomingdales for some shopping and cupcakes. I imagine that any weekend that starts with a trip to Bloomies and Magnolia Cupcakes will certainly be a great weekend. Teddy and I spent the entire day together on Saturday. The longest walk in the morning, just bopping around the neighborhood, and then an especially long trip to the dog park. I'm telling you, that place has turned into my happy place. Teddy was moving a mile a minute and this is the best picture I could get! He comes over from time to time to say hello.. and the second I give him a tiny pet he's off like lightning to go chase a dog or a ball. I wish I had tracked how far we had walked total. Sheesh! My legs were killing me. We even strolled over to Central Park because it was such a beautiful day. Actually while I was there, I realized that I had no plans for Saturday night. The last thing I wanted was to just sit around my apartment all night watching Netflix. (Please note: I do love a good Netflix night though.) I randomly bought tickets for Once. I've been listening to a few of the songs on Pandora and it's been just sitting on my to-do list forever. So I paid way too much for a ticket and zipped downtown for the 8pm show. OH MY GOSH. Definitely in my top five favorite Broadway show. Seriously amazing. The songs and music are incredible. I love that the cast is the orchestra. I've been listening to the soundtrack all day long. MUST SEE. A random pick, but I've had to up my SPF game because I've been spending so much time outdoors. I typically wear makeup with SPF 15 or 20. This Clinique Super City Block has been saving me... sooooo good. SPF 40 for the win. This morning? I took Teddy to Central Park for off-leash hours. I was super nervous about it, but he's very well-behaved and responds to calling his name. He did so well. He was so happy running around and meeting people and dogs. The key is to go early, so I'm going to try to get out there with him every morning now. Then I got ready and went to a gorgeous brunch at the Upstairs at the Kimberly Hotel with French Connection . All of the bloggers donned French Connection flirty floral dresses. I felt like a little princess in the dress. So perfect for spring! 50% hanging out outside and 50% getting dressed up for fun NYC things. Perfect balance! How was your weekend? What's coming up for you this week? xoxo",

A lot of offices in NYC have \"Summer Fridays,\" which means they either have a handful of Fridays they can choose to take off or the office shuts down every Friday in the early afternoon. That means that every Friday during the summer there's a mass exodus for vacations. Shared rentals in the Hampton's, roadtrips to the outer banks in North Carolina, staycations nearby, or jetting off to amazing locations (and taking Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday off). This is the first summer that I don't have set plans for travel, but I imagine that a few trips will pop up! #fingerscrossed Kate Spade just released a fun little bag for travel . Bring it to the beach or use as a carryon or tote it around while playing tourist.

Also, the legwear options are bleak. I've decided that I hate tights (this year ~ I reserve the right to have changed my opinion in another 12 months) and so that basically leaves me with two options: pants or my thigh-high boots. Thank the fashion fairies for those boots! Between my Chanel almost-flats and my Jimmy Choo heels , I have an option for nearly any occasion ~ they're the only thing keeping getting dressed interesting at the moment. With a sure-to-be-frigid Fashion Week fast approaching, I'm wondering if perhaps I need another option or two.

I couldn't get it to look right, so I washed it all out\u2026 but not before taking this pic. 2. I was never a fan of banana flavoring for most of my life, but in the past year, it's become my favorite. Here, a banana shake from Bub's (perhaps the best burger in town?) 3. My guest room had become a dump until I sorted and put away all that laundry. This is just a portion of the ironing pile I'm still working on. 4. I took a spin at the Antique Mall looking for 50s and 60s fabric, instead I went home with a May 1965 McCalls magazine (and a 1960 LIFE, a vintage sewing pattern and a 1950s cookbook). 5. Playing around with pretty spring nail colors - Nicole by OPI's Find Your Passion and Enuf is Enuf by Essie. 6. Pink dogwoods are. so. beautiful. 7. I wore this watch on Monday, right after the season premier of Mad Men. Doesn't it look like something Don Draper would wear? 8.

Grant is a 17 year old hardcore republican proud WASP from the swamps of Tampa, Florida. You shouldve seen his reaction and his balls when I told him he looked Jewish and how can he be a WASP when both of his names are blacker than Naomi Campbell, Iman, Michael Jordan, Lil Kim. Hes such a darling. We talked on the phone sometime last week for 3 whole hours with him saying \"Oh my god\" for at least 300 times per hour. He also claims hes straight however, my ever reliable gaydar says hes lying. I mean, come on, what kind of straight 17 year old reads GQ, wants to study acting in Julliard (sp?), currently a waiter at Shake and Bake (knock-knock-cliche, we all know about waiters who want to be actors but end up being drug addicts and prostitutes), wants Prada, knows ton about fashion, hangs out with a ton of girls (fag hags), whines, whinges and complains about everything in the world whenever the opportunity arrives? EVERYBODY TELL HIM HES IN DENIAL. D-E-N-I-A-L DENIAL! THE WALK IN WARDROBE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FUCKING CLOSET! TALK ABOUT SUFFOCATION. YA NEED SPACE FOR YER HANDBAGS SWEETHEART Remember: teenage angst is your one-way ticket to enchanted fagdom! Anyway, Ill leave it up to you to decide whether or not Grant is a breeder or a fag. I say FAG! Regardless of his sexuality, I think hes a really nice guy and Im glad that we talked. If only hes legal and if only miscegenation is acceptable, I wouldnt mind him being the father of my first child. Think about it: mixed raced babies are the Chanel of babies.

Though theyve offered plus sizes for a while now, they acknowledged the need to make things better and have spent the past year researching what plus size women want and perfecting fit issues. If youve had problems with their size chart in the past, know that they have revamped everything and starting now, their plus items should fit much more true to size. Theyre totally open to constant improvement, welcome feedback, and encourage women to share reviews, pictures, and information on how each item fits. Make sure you check out their site if you havent lately! I wore a Dorothy Perkins blazer (on sale here), Forever21 jeans and top, and Aldo heels: (I did cut my hair, but not that much! Its pinned back.) PS- For those of you that loved the ASOS Maternity swing dress I wore recently, they just added it to the Curve collection, but its already sold out in white!

Seriously, it takes less than ten minutes to do my make-up in the morning and its mostly fool-proof. However, it seems that when I originally purchased the first kit of colors, I was very tan and chose the medium skin tone. It also seems that over the past three years, tanning has been less appealing to me (maybe because our pool is underground and sucks or maybe because my dad died of skin cancer could be either?) anyway, lets just say Im not so tan any more but somehow I still thought I was. I would try to add make-up to my neck to blend it but it never EVER really blended right. Last week I went to Sephora and decided to try the lighter shade (fairly light instead of just light). I recall trying this color before and it being too pink for meor at least I thought. It is not until now, face and neck the same (or really close to the same) color that I realize that I have been walking around with orange face for at least two years. Im not going to lie, someone mentioned to Pep that I shouldnt wear so much make-up and he informed me of my mistake too. But he just said TOO MUCH MAKE-UP- not THE WRONG COLOR. So it didnt click for me. Im going to TRY to pretend that I actually WAS as tan as I thought I was for a while at least, so as not to crawl up into a whole of embarrassment admitting it was THREE YEARS. Either way, the first step is realizing the problem. I can say that Im not in denial any more and no longer have a case of the orange face! unbelievable Share on: Maegan Tintari LA native & lifestyle blogger Maegan Tintari writes daily at ...love Maegan.com sharing beauty & style secrets, including fashion DIYs, how-to nail art manicures, hair tutorials, and home decorating ideas, as well as a look into her personal life with her husband and adorable dogs, two Frenchies & an old Pug in wheels.

        "extracted_text": "image via Thread for Thought In spirit of the departed Halloween, paying tribute to Tim Burtons sharpestpun intendedcharacter seemed like a no brainer and since I have no brain, I jumped on the opportunity to take you, fellow Repellows, on a virtual (and magical) journey through images and items that may or may not deliberately draw inspiration from the man with the scissor hands. Excess leather, bondage, beltage, messy bed hair and metal details make for one bomb, bad, kick and sweet ass outfit. And because most these looks include leather, a fabric notorious for its uncanny ability to man-get (cue the sex shops,) I strongly suggest you opt to wear scissor as hands while channeling Eddie. After all, few great outfits are complete if at the end of the night youre not alone. Lets take a strut (pun fun, right here) down past runways, courtesy of Style.com: Rick Owens rarely if ever designs a collection without channeling the queen of Darkness and last fall was no exception. The inclusion however, of heavy black eye make up and big fail whales in the form of slicked back hair-do had the models ten blades away from becoming bizarro scissorhands. Note the Seinfeld reference. See what I mean? Those gloves are begging for blades. And Im just throwing this in for good measure because it would be unbecoming of someone who calls herself the Man Repeller not to. Look, its a leather hat, slash hood, slash condom, slash cape, slash fur accoutrement. Heres Ricks wife, shot by Jak&Jil;, doing Tim Burton, little black riding hood, tobacco supporters and myself proud. You should really look into finding a new nail salon. At Elise Overland, things were slightly more feminine: Looking at these images now, I question the initial Tim Burton connection I made. Sure, there are shoulder pads and leather turtlenecks, but are these repellers? Will a man weigh in? Man, WOULD YOU HAVE SEX WITH THESE WOMEN? images via Jak&Jil; Kate the Great, I love you so hard. You may say moto-chic, but I say Burton chic. And finally, heres me looking suicide chic and what not. I was initially holding several pairs of scissors between my finger tips but I accidentally cut a block of hair out of my head which was fairly traumatic for the events of a Thursday night at 9PM just before heading out for dinner. jacket by Veda, leather pants by Topshop, sheer blouse by Dolce & Gabbana, bow booties by Opening Ceremony I accidentally cut my hair in the name of this blog, dont ever say I dont love you. Repellows, Im sorry if you didnt laugh through the duration of this post but aside from the fact that I am now missing a small patch of hair, I am not a machine that produces infinite funny words at the drop of a ruffle. Just kidding, I am. And in honor of this chilly Friday theres one more thing I have to share with you:Winter loving turban wearers, rejoice! Yesterday, fellow repellow Cecilia sent me a photo of Peter Jensens knit turban equipped with center pom pom et al! I nearly shot myself in the leg when I signed in to order the turban and learned the $120 centerpiece was already sold out. And then, I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. Cecilia assured me the red one, that would match any gentiles Christmas decorations was still in stock. If you werent sure before, you should be now: Tis the season to be Man Repelling.",

At left, Miu Miu pays an exhausting homage to the 70s in the same capacity Balenciagas Pre Fall relives 1982. The shoes are, how you say, icing on that cake.

This should yield a general call to put the credit card down and look back to your current belongings. The shoes youve got still have a decent couple seasons under their cinderblocks. And in other shews (shoes x news = shews): I am not, however, above the continuing manifestation of senior citizen approved heels on a young, sleek, albeit long leg. Beyond the rising fame of Valentinos kitten heel, a general interest in the resurgence of the chunkier mini heel started last summer when I found myself gravitating toward a pair of Ferragamo shoes fit for not my grandmother, but her mother. It was only a matter of months before Chanels version fell onto my lap and subsequently foot. This was followed by Stella McCartneys resort push. And thats just a little biography outlining the happenings of my foot. At left here, Chloe, right Valentino. Ultimately, the moral of this story is to have comfort seekers rejoice in the notion that you dont have to give up your natural inclinations, that is, avoiding death by shoe, for the sake of your foots well being.

        "extracted_text": "One Tuesday afternoon, I bought a Chanel bag. I had to do it. I have always harbored a poorly concealed crush on the 2.55s boxy frame and softly glazed lambskin. Even when the chain-linked miracle prostituted itself on the arm of Snooki, my love for its classic appeal never wavered. I know that its been deemed suburban and ubiquitous and that all of the Real Housewives carry it, but there is something about its enduring charm that reminds me of my grandmother and pearls and Alexa Chung. So when I spotted it online and on salewhich happens once every neverand discounted by a healthy 30%, I did not hesitate. Now was not the time to ask myself such questions as, Can you put a down payment on a bag? or Do people really sell their kidneys on the black market? I had only one option: Add to Cart. I owned it for exactly thirty minutes. A brief interlude for sanity: Im twenty years old and in college. I may not have the best handle on fiscal responsibility, but Im not financially suicidal. Also, Id prefer that my parents not disown me for retail dalliances that result in the purchase of inky-black leather goods. I could not buy the bag. But I could pretend. For the brief window it would sit in my shopping cart, it would be mine. I wish I could say this is the first time Ive succumbed to such behavior. Years ago, on the last day of a trip to London, I ambled into the Burberry flagship and tried on a trench coat. I slipped each arm through its meticulously pressed sleeves while the store manager bustled about and illustrated her expert tailoring suggestions with a smattering of pins. I was not in the market for this class of investment. But I let the woman in plaid go on, and when she was finished ministering to the garment, I appraised my reflection and asked her if I could put in on hold. Until the end of the day, she said. That would be wonderful, I replied effortlessly. Thank you so much. By the time the store closed that day, I was halfway over the Atlantic. I am in love with the idea of sequestering things I know I cannot have. Its an indulgent practice. Its childish. But fast-forward half a decade and save for a blissful half hour I once spent with my best friend eating raw cookie dough straight from the supermarket package, those 1,800 seconds of fabricated Chanel proprietorship were some of the most exhilarating of my life. They were also the most agonizing. No sooner had I staked my claim in the storied House of Chanel than the cool, mathematical robots behind Shopbop.coms glossy faade saw to its excruciating undoing. But I found my silver lining. Now was my chance, I reasoned. Why stop at Chanel when I could also fictitiously load up on Wang and Stella McCartney? When I could buy white satin loafers? Why settle for a $2,240 price tag when I could let my subtotal wander into quintuple digits with no repercussions? Who would care if I did? You dont pay shipping fees on delusions. As I bid a prolonged adieu to something Id never had, my forever-unrealized future with the original cross-body flashed before my eyes. I imagined slipping it over my shoulder on the cusp of promising Saturday nights only to rescue it later from sticky tables and slimy boys. I envisioned wearing it with sequins and satin and seersucker. Years would go by, and its changing contents would reflectwhat? Maturity? One day I would pass it onits insides defaced with errant pen markings and lipstick stainsto a featureless daughter of mine. Wed had a good run, Id think lovingly, as I bequeathed it to her. Wed been perfect together! But, of course, we hadnt been. We were separating before our first date. We loved each other, but we were irreconcilable. We were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, and although I rooted for us, I knew all along that our differences were insurmountable. Predictably, one of us would rebound (ed note: ricochet) faster than the other. About seven seconds after my thirty-minute grace period had elapsed, I Rip the Band-Aid! refreshed the web page and braced myself. The bag, Shopbop.com informed me, was already sold out. To the woman who swooped in and snatched my shot at happiness: Please be kind. Respect it. Treasure it for more than thirty minutes. Give it the life I never could. Also, friend me on Facebook so that I can stalk you obsessively and inevitably discover that you are French and look sexy in overalls. -Written by Mattie Kahn.

I promptly flooded his inbox with infographics on the effect of girls education, which is largely accepted as the most efficient means to fighting poverty globally. Literally. Check out the infographic. Whats even more surprising is that a major obstacle to girls education in the developing worldis menstruation, which causes many girls to miss a quarter of their schooling.It never occurred to me that a womans period would prevent her from doing anything. Except maybe wearing white, or swimming in shark-infested waters. I assumed everyone had some means of handling their flow and going on with their day-to-day lives. Not the case. Which is why I fell in love with programs likePads for Peaceand Pads4Girls. In the case of Pads for Peace, anEliminate Poverty Nowproject, not only are girls receiving washable menstrual pads enabling them to stay on top of their school work and continue their education the RockPads are manufactured at a local sewing center at Little Rock ECD Centre in Nairobi, Kenya, creating jobs for women in the community. Issues like global poverty are so mammoth its sometimes overwhelming for a single person wanting to help. The fact that these programs isolate an obstacle and offer an uncomplicated, effective solution is wonderfully refreshing. And the end result girls receiving an education is the best part.",

        "extracted_text": "The price were willing to pay for beauty can vary a great deal. You can be wiling to pay an arm and a leg for practical beauty tools or stand firm that drugstore brands get the job done. With so many options it isnt hard to see why people test out the most buzzed about products no matter the price tag. When it comes to buying there are a few rules I follow, but in general if it has solid reviews, contains quality ingredients and applies well, Im in. Ive tried hundreds of productsmany that have blown my mindbut today I wanted to feature 5 of those that no matter what, theyre worth the splurge. JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. 1. Rm DNA Renewal DNA Sheer Defense Wearing SPF on your face should be a no brainer at this point, but its rare that we think about that protection as a way to help collagen growth as well. DNA Renewal is part of a circle of products emerging that not only act as a light BB Cream with 50+ SPF, but also works to repair existing sun damage with enzymes and vitamins. You could save your money and stick with a 30 SPF face lotion or you can go big to fight cellular damage, even out your skins tone and texture, and be confident that youll have all-day coverage without a high shine, oily finish. 2. La Mer The Lip Balm - La Mer as a brand is no joke. Ive been using their Creme de la Mer for ages, so its not surprising that their a celeb and overall cult fave despite the jaw dropping fee. The Lip Balm is no different. Containing the brands mystery Miracle Broth the balm goes on sheer while moisturizing and restoring your lips texture. Since the skin on our lips is one of the most sensitive, and easily affected by the elements, its important to take great care of them. If youve ever used a balm that had your lips thirsting for another application, you know that you can become dependent on a product. With La Mer that wont happen, but youll want to apply it when necessary for a silky smooth, mega hydrated pout. And if you cant justify using it for only your lips, luckily there are plenty of other uses for lip balm. 3. MAC Cosmetics Penultimate Eye Liner - There are a lot of formulas to use and ways to apply your eyeliner. One that always seems like an easy solution, even for the makeup novice, is a liquid marker-like liner. However most, especially those with more affordable price tags, rarely deliver the color results desired and tend to go on more watery and require more effort than your pencil, cream or typical liquid liner. But when you find the right one, these pen style liners offer precision application and major color payoff. Thats why the MAC Penultimate Liner is a must. Along with the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Liner, these liners dress up your eyes and go on flawlessly. 4. NCLA Nail Lacquers It can be hard to justify paying $16 for nail polish, especially when we change our polish as quickly as our minds. But between all the brands on the market and color options available, sometimes there seems to be a lack of new, original hues to polish on. Thats where NCLA kills it and is worth every penny. While there are crazy neon colors (which arent true neons btw) from cheaper brands, there just isnt that same confetti meets summer vibe meets Oh You Say You Have Nail Wraps too! like NCLA offers. Their creamy lacquers are made right here in California and are 5-free. And their holographic lineneed I say more! 5. AmorePacific Color Control Cushion Compact Cushion compacts were one of the most buzzed about beauty products last year and for good reason. Just like MACs eye liner, you have a lot of options when it comes to foundation application, but what makes the AmorePacific Cushion Compact worth the $60 splurge is that its basically 3 beauty products rolled into one. The coverage is unbelievable, the cushion applicator allows you to build your product up for light to heavy coverage days, the cushion also provides a streak-free finish (no brushes required) and it touts SPF 50.

        "extracted_text": "This Sunday marks the end of Daylight Savings Time, which means most of us will be given an extra hour this weekend to do whatever we want! Growing up, this extra hour was never wasted; most of the time, it was spent helping out with family chores or cleaning up and organizing around the house. While I cant force you to do these things on Sunday (Im not your parent, I cant make you), I would encourage you to make the most out of this hour and have an extra productive day! Do something that you would normally put off, or something that isnt really a priority but would be nice to get to at some point. If youre anything like me, bathroom organization is something that definitely falls into this category. My bathroom could always use a little cleaning up not in the sense that its dirty, but in the sense that it tends to get a little clutteredproducts tend to accumulate, cabinets fill up, and blow dryers get tossed aside in a hurry out the door. And dont even get me started on the mountains of makeup : / So, my challenge for you is this: Make the place where you get beautiful more beautiful, and do a little bathroom organization this weekend. It can be hard to know where to start with organization projects, but here are some easy things you can do to clean out your bathroom and maximize your space. 1. Get rid of your old makeup. Here are some guidelines for knowing when its time to toss it. 2. The backs of cabinet doors are organization gold: hang things, store tools, add jars or hooks, adhere a magnetic strip to keep pins in one placethe opportunities are endless! 3. Dont just dump your things on the counter! Well, at least make them look good: head to a craft store or discount home store and pick up some cute jars to toss your things in. Either mix and match, or go for a more classic look with glass or metal jars. You can also use pretty bowls and plates to hold any jewelry you wear on the reg. It will look tidier and more thoughtful! 4. Nail polish storage can actually be very pretty too. Keep your polishes in a giant clear glass jar no more hiding them in a basket under the sink! 5. Clean. Your. Brushes. You have the time! (Click here for my ultimate brush cleaner.) 6. Organize your go-to makeup. Acrylic trays are great compartmentalizers. You can either buy something like this from IKEA thats specifically for cosmetics, or get inexpensive desk organizers from any organization or super store. This is a great way to store your everyday makeup but also keep it readily accessible. There are so many ways you can clean up and prettify a bathroom, but those are just a few. Getting ready in a neat and tidy area will make you feel so much more zen, especially if you have to share a bathroom! Let me know if you try any of these methods out! And please share your own helpful organization tricks in the comments section belowI just might feature them in a future blog!

I think Penang might now be one of my favorite travel destinations. White sandy beaches and lots of great food down Gurney Drive. Australians and Brits definitely agree, they are all over the place here having a good time, but only now are Americans just beginning to come. Everyone was telling me to try the famous Asam Laksa in Penang and I have to say, it is SO yummy! I can really take spicy foods, but not as much as I used to. Growing up, I put chili on just about everything haha! I also really like the soy bean milk they serve there a lot! Plus, we had an awesome taxi driver, Ali, who would fetch us here, there, and everywhere, all whiling giving us lots of good information as well as making us laugh just about every five seconds!!But weve definitely had other few crazy taxi drivers which nearly scared the crap outta me. But but all in all, I had a safe and wonderful time in Penang. And like I said, very easy dressing. High waisted denim shorts and tanks are my new best friend. After Penang, I spent the last 2 days in Thailand! Took so many beautiful photos. Cant wait to take a look at them later! But now, I am back in KL for a bit! :)))",

I love a good cheeky sweater arriving just before nut-so fashion week to keep me sane. Plus, its so darn cute, I wear it with everything.

Plaid, black skinnies, and of course a classic VANS sneaker is all I need on a busy work week.

The brand has reached an iconic status in my life and on my blog, as this is where most of my favorite shoes come from. The impeccable ability of combining classy uppers and sporty bottoms still fascinates me and the brand stays true to its image from collection to collection. You probably just fell in love how I did, so go check out the website and take a look at the new collection worth every penny! Moving farther up we have my pants from Forever 21 which cost a solid $19 if Im not mistaken and look phenomenal, especially if youre looking for a nice, robust and very slim dress pant. I played with the upper body combination, layering a leather jacket over a cardigan over a turtleneck, hoping to introduce a rocknroll element to the otherwise pretty dapper look. I was super happy with how the shoot turned out, Lisa and I are playing a lot more with photography these days to keep it fresh for you guys, so I hope you appreciate it ;) Previous articletangled Next articleBeanie Weather",

On Wednesday, both E. Tautz as well as Oliver Spencer showed their collections, which were my favorites in London (recap has yet to come!). Before Oliver Spencer started, we were part of a little catastrophe: a hot water pipe burst open and steaming hot water started raining on dozens of people who had already taken their seats. After a quick break, and luckily no cancellation, everything was restored and we could enjoy the show. During London Collections I spent a lot of time at The Apartment, which was a rented apartment, as a hangout spot for bloggers and other attendees of LC:M in between shows. It was so nice to meet different people there, and have a little refuge to regain some strength, as running around can be quite exhausting. Also, they are sponsored by awesome brands such as Fossil and Russel & Bromley, which is where I got the bag and shoes from, respectively. My time in London is now almost over, and it has been a fantastic experience, with wonderful people I have met and beautiful places I have seen and been to until the next time, London!

Not only did I get to wear some truly glamourous pieces, but I became introduced to amazing new Russian designers, and of course the talented team I worked with. Here is the second set of photos from the shoot. There are so many looks I loved, it was hard to choose which photos to share! Which is your favorite? You can see the article online here. Look 1: Ive made my decision- its hand down my favorite look of the whole shoot. Im absolutely obsessed with the shape and the handwritten print on this Alexander Terekhov dress.

Seeing these screen shots of me on a huge billboard in Times Square. Im literally speechless and dont think I can even explain how I feel. Most importantly Im beyond thankful to all of you for your support. My blog is so important to me and I work extremely hard on it. Ive never felt proud, or thought that it was anything special. Its just me laying on my bed, writing about what I love- fashion. People will say to me Your blog is doing so well, and Im always like No, no its nothing really. But for some reason when I saw these pictures, for the first time in my life I felt like what Im doing is important, and people actually care and are listening. Its not about me, its about the blogging world in general and all my fashion blogger friends who are working so hard and accomplishing amazing things that a few years ago no one would have thought was possible. Im not a model or an actress just a normal, small town girl whos passionate about something she loves. Its a dream come true to be able to share that with people around the world and I hope I can inspire others that anything is possible. Unfortunately I wont be in NY at all this month to see it myself so if anyone happens to be there and could send me a video of it I would be so grateful :)Of course huge thank you to Forever 21 and Alex & Chloe who made this all happen!

        "extracted_text": "December 29, 2014 A Little DIY Wabi Sabi Whereas most of us value things that are perfect and enduring, wabi sabi is the Japanese worldview that sees beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness. Things such as a slightly lopsided vase, a shirt thats missing a button, or an old, wooden desk thats a little too dry. Its believed that by recognizing the beauty in such things, we can better appreciate the natural cycle of life from growth to decay to eventually death. Jonathan Lukacek the very talented blogger behind Bandanna Almanac is certainly familiar with the concept. Hes an American living in Japan, having stayed there after studying abroad for college. Hes also aninveterate thrifter who likes to collect garments with a lot character (rather than things that happen to be rare or hold value). In other words, things that tell a story, as he put it to me. Seen above are some of the creative ways hes repaired his vintage finds. Theres a pair of jeans with pocket bags made from cut-up bandannas; a dirty collar of a denim shirt made new again through some more bandanna cloth; an old Five Brothers flannel with a slightly askew internal pocket (made with just the right amount of pattern matching); a denim jacket with blanket lining on the outside of the coat; and finally, some decorative sashiko stitching on the collar of an old chambray shirt. Everything was done with fabrics that Jonathan has either thrifted or found over the years. Some repairs he did himself; others he did in collaboration with his good friend Narita at Brown Tabby (a vintage repair shop in Japan). All of it is awesome especially if youve ever appreciated anything at a thrift store or flea market, or even the designer lines that are inspired by such things (e.g. Blue Blue Japan, Kapital, and Visvim). You can see more of Jonathans work at his Instagram account. He also occasionally sells things atEtsy and eBay. # Posted in Bandanna Almanac Wabi Sabi Jonathan Lukacek Brown Tabby Blue Blue Japan Kapital Visvim Our Benefactors Search Follow On Twitter Blog RSS Feed Podcast RSS Feed iTunes Feed Post Categories Q and ANSWER Best Of the Blog It's On Sale eBay Roundup Spring Summer Fall Winter Shirts Jackets Shoes Coats Accessories Ties Further Benefactors Buy From Us Watch the Videos Best Of Recent \"Best Of\" Posts Our Editorial & Advertising Policies Put This On Season One 25 Things You Should Know Alterations: Can I...?

        "extracted_text": "July 24, 2014 Fragrances, Part Two: How to Choose Something for Yourself In some ways, choosing a fragrance is straightforward: you pick something youd want to wear. At the same time, theres more to it than just sniffing the bottle. The first thing you need to know is that fragrances react to your body and evolve over time. So when youre out shopping for a scent, only use the blotter strips to see what youd like to sample, and then spray no more than one scent per wrist. That way, your nose wont be confused. As you wear those scents throughout the day, pay attention to how they change. Scents are described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, which make up a harmonious scent accord. These notes are released over time: Top notes: Also known as the head notes, these are what you smellupon immediate application. Top notes are very strong and assertive, and often a bit citrusy. I find them to be too strong when Im in public, so I apply scents about five minutes before going outside. A scents top notes will have evaporated by then. Middle notes:Next are the middle notes, which typically last for about thirty minutes. Middle notes form the heart of a fragrance, and are usually much more well-rounded and mellow. Basenotes: A fragrances middle notes and basenotes form the real theme of a fragrance, which is why you need to give it time before you judge it. Basenotes start to come out after the first thirty minutes and will last until the scentdisappears. In addition to paying attention to how something evolves, think about what youre smelling and whether those scents are suitable for your needs. Things that smell very citrusy, floral, green, or aquatic, for example, might only be good for daytime use, or for the spring and summer seasons. Conversely, things that smell more like wood, amber, vanilla, or leather might be better for nighttime use, or for the fall and winter seasons. Whether something is right for you is as much about when you plan to wear it as it is about your personality. Once youve picked something, the rest is easy. Storing: Fragrances are sensitive to light and heat, so store things in cool and dry places, and away from direct sunlight. On top your dresser is fine; on the dashboard of your car is not. Application: Generally speaking, you want to spray fragrances about 3-6 inches away from your body, and directly on pulse points (so neck, inner elbow, or wrist). Remember, fragrances need to react to your body, so dont apply scents to your clothes. I personally spray stuff on my wrist, and then lightly dab my wrists on my neck. (Rubbing is bad for the oils). Whatever you do, dont spray fragrances into the air and walk through the mist. That does little more than freshen up the room. Amount: How much you apply is personal, and will depend on the strength of what youre spraying. Some things require a bit more application; some things less. Obviously: when in doubt, always err on the side of caution. If you want something to last long, just get a longer lasting scent, rather than go wild with a weak one. Finally, if you want to try out a new scent, or just develop your nose, buy samplers before you buy bottles. Doing so can be a nice way to check things out without dropping too much money. The Perfumed Court is a popular online source, and you can do a Google search forfragrance decants. You can also find good reviews at Basenotes, where theres a large online community of enthusiasts.

        "extracted_text": "Perhaps it is my life-long obsession with bugs but when I can never help but notice the resemlance between a shiny satin Lanvin sheath and the phosphorescent shell of a dogbane beetle. The darted shifts at Balenciaga last week, shown on stick-like models with elfish booties, were no exception. In fact, many things the past two seasons have caught my eye as being reminiscent of the entomological. The closing dress at Nina Ricci was ethereal and evoked many different emotional responses. It featured the print of a chrysalis . I love that Theyskens could take something from nature so bizarre (the shell of a cicada always makes me wonder if theyre not the fetuses of alien spawn) and make it both wearable and beautiful. The models bare shoulders and the volumuminous sleeves remind one of the actual process of metamorphosis-the pretty butterfly (aka Tanya) coming out of its shell. The frothy fur at Chloe made me think of nothing other than the downy wings of a luna moth, complete with its spots and tufts of hair. I spotted similarly wing-like patterning at Prada-dont the marbled designs of the tunic and the transparency remind you of butterflies? Very dreamy. I also loved the strange cutouts on Marios Scwabs wobble dress this season. The gathered fabric peeping out of these perforations immiediatley brought to mind-and this may sound disgusting-insect larvaebut in a totally awesome sci-fi way. And of course you cant forget the whimsical shoes and pins at Miu Miu this springcheck out the sandal with the beetle on it! A little far out for me, but I would still love one of those dragonfly pins. I dont know, maybe I should ditch my love of fashion to persue entomologyor I could get the Miu Miu brooch and have the best of both worlds.jane",

What other designer delivers on every aspect of its line? Hermes has its iconic birkins but the Gaultier designed clothes are so boring, Chanel bags are the good ol classics but the clothing of late lack inspiration (I mean how many little Chanel tweed jackets do I need? They all look alike after a while), Fendi should have stuck with the ever popular baguette instead of a slew of hideous self proclaimed it bags (although I love its line of clothes by Karl), everyone agrees that Jimmy Choo shoes are fab but the bags should not be seen in the light of day, and Valentino, well you guys knows how we feel about its line of bags. But Lanvin, Lanvin is magical, and yes, I am biased but dont tell me this bag doesnt make you want to whip out your Amex!

        "extracted_text": "I received a sample of the Jamie O at home microdermabrasion kit from Jamie O herself last month. We have a mutual friend who loves the product and wanted me to try it. I was hesitant at first because I didnt know if Id like it and well, you all know how brutal I am when I dont like something but my friend was so certain Id love it that she told me to be honest and review it as I would any other product. She put me in touch with Jamie and within 48 hours a package arrived at my door, the box was the prettiest skincare package Id ever seen! Pink with grey trim wrapped in a gorgeous grey ribbon, it was so pretty I didnt want to open it or mess it up. I finally opened it tonight and tried the microdermabrasion scrub and let me just say, WOW.Every winter I get regular microdermabrasion facials (from Katrina at Cooper Spa!) but it leaves my skin too vulnerable in the summer so I depend on over the counter scrubs to exfoliate during the hot months. I usually use the Fresh Sugar face polish and La Prairie essential exfoliator but will be adding this to my repertoire. How is Jamie O different from my other scrubs you ask? First of all, the crystals are so fine it felt like the soft sands of the Maldives. And it smelled like a dreamcicle (from the vitamin C). The best part is the lactic acid to put on top of the scrub called the activator, my face got really hot for about 5 seconds, very science project-ish and kinda scary at first but it went away very quickly. After rinsing it off, my skin was smooth like porcelain. Its very close to the same smoothness achieved with a professional microdermabrasion machine but at a fraction of the cost. At $69, it is less than half the price of a one time microdermabrasion session and will last you all summer.

Now, if youre about to enter the new age bracket (the 35-45 box at the doctors office) or above, you need to know about this! I was sent a sample of Sensais Eye Wrinkle cream a month ago and despite the PR person warning me it was very rich and probably best for a more mature skin, I generously applied it twice a day. The consistency is really thick but goes on fairly smoothly and I liked how it nourishing it felt around the eyes (and diminished the lines!). However, I noticed a tiny white bump under my right eye recently which my facialist tells me is probably from over use of the very rich eye cream! So Im back to using my iS clinical eye cream (heard they have a new version coming, out cant wait!) and saving this for days I feel really old and tired. If you are very dry or have very mature skin definitely try this. Go ask for a sample at the counter at Neiman/Bergdorf and see if its too rich for you.

        "extracted_text": "The other week I went to a Sephora event to check-out their March/April Hot Now products and was immediately blown away by Josie Marans Argan Matchmaker Serum Foundation ($42). Its a sci-fi-like foundation that looks white when you apply it on your skin and then a second later it adapts to your color to blend in seamlessly. It comes in a light and dark shade and I was standing next to a woman of color who took the dark shade, while I tried the light one and it actually worked for both of us! Seriously very cool to play with. Its got a light consistency, which Im guessing is because of the Argan oil in its formulation, so the plus is that aside from not needing to sort through a bunch of shades to find the right one for you, the Matchmaker works double duty to moisturize skin. I personally prefer a thicker formulation however, so while I dont think I will be giving up my Sensai Liquid Finish Foundation anytime soon (their Natural Beige saved me from years of less than perfect foundation for my skin tone!), there are a bunch of celebrities that could seriously use some help when it comes to matching makeup to their skin.

You know how your body needs a good detoxing sometimes? Well, our hair is the same. The build-up from products, chlorine, pollution, and simple hair grease take their toll and every so often our hair needs a chance to get back to its natural state. Well, only a good total cleansing can achieve that. Sure, the delicate shampoos are great to prevent stripping and drying, but once in awhile you need more.So how about a shampoo that is gentle, but cleans your hair so thoroughly that it is actually softer, more manageable, and more voluminous? So much so that you dont even recognize it as your own hair?! I bought this shampoo in preparation for the impending summer of swimming in pools, thinking it would be the perfect product to purify my hair of chlorine.I decided to test it out ahead of time and was blown away. My hair took on a whole new characteristic. I had thought my hair felt heavy because of its thickness and that was why it seemed so unstylable. But I was wrong it was all because of toxic build-up. After one shampooing my hair was as smooth and shiny as if Id just gotten a blow-out. It felt completely different soft and feathery something I never thought my hair could ever be. Made with molasses and baking soda, the consistency and color is just like molasses. It wafts a hint of a Chinese herbal scent, which I personally love, but it might take others some getting used to. I followed up with Pure Basic Trumint Conditioner, which hydrated my hair and scalp. Its scent of rosemary and mint is really nice. I recommend using both but if anything, the shampoo is a must try!

When you have it on your shoulder the texture of the leather allows for incredible draping that isnt too scrunched, you get that perfect sculptural scallop. There is a hidden magnetic closure so when the two sides are closed, the draping is more of a fold. You get subtle changes in the look depending on how it slouches. The strap is long enough to hang comfortably at your side and it stays on! It is also super lightweight. I cant decide what I love most the shape, function or beauty! It is stark white, gorgeous for summer, but do not fear, the paper laminate allows for easy spot cleaning.

It also shows confidence, yep, even though pink has worked its way into every menswear department and subsequent boardroom, it still carries the stigma of being a girls colour. Dont let it!

Loom pretty much stocks the ultimate collection of awesome, pretty much the kind of stuff that ends up on my want of the week wall. Its all cult status stuff, brands like Commes des Garons, Fred Perry, A.P.C and even some limited edition footwear for sneaker heads.

        "extracted_text": "Essentials No 2 The Cardigan Sweater The cardigans origin dates back to the 17th century as a piece of traditional fishermans clothing, but it was not until James Thomas Brudnell (the 7th Earl of Cardigan) lead a suicidal cavalry charge against a Russian canyon killing all of his men that the garment become famous. You see, James Brudnell wore it because he could slip it on and off without disarranging his hair and after that whole disastrous cavalry ride made him the talk of the town, the cardigan was adopted as a fashion craze in high society. It was only after the Second World War that cardigans left the world of formal attire and became symbolic of relaxation. From here on they were adopted by golfers and singers alike, everyone from Arnold Palmer to Bing Crosby and even singers who like to golf like ol blue eyes, Mr Frank Sinatra, who was said to have dropped $30 000 a year on knitwear at his local club house. It wasnt until Kurt Cobain wore his cardigan in the 1990s as part of his grunge look that the garment lost its grandpa stigma and became a piece of the modern mans wardrobe. For me, the cardigan still carries I like a little bit of both worlds, the dapper granmps and the urban trendsetter which makes it super versatile. So, why do I consider it an essential, well, I just said, its super versatile, it works as well casually with some jeans and a t-shirt as it does layered under a sports coat with a tie, or even worn as a jacket on its own. I reccomend getting a couple in different textures and weights, each of them will offer a different wardrobe solution. The one above is my current favourite, Its nice and chunky and really nails the grandpa look with that roll (or shawl) collar.

Its simple and classic though it very rarely sees the light of day, till Fancy Friday that is. Then, there are the 2 tone brogues, these guys are awesome, but incredibly difficult to wear, and if the rule is that your belt matches your shoes, well then, what colour do you match? What happens if like me, you have a belt that matches neither? I simply went for a black belt and let the blazer match the shoes, it still helps getting items in your outfit talking to one another. Lets look at the details though. The camo bow tie was to pick up on the contrast collar of the blazer, its also got some black in it so helps blend in with the outfit overall I think. To be able to make this all work, together, I thought a simple white shirt with the slightest texture was best, it has a nice french cuff, so the silver on the watch and cufflink could allwork together matching metal with metal is key, and perhaps a dressiquette post I need to wright up one day So If you like this look, below are some online choices to help get you started, the exact blazer and shoes were impossible to find.

In this case it was the tie, Im a sucker for new things, and having just received a package from the gents at Weekend Casualstuffed with accessories as well as having come back from a major shopping trip in Johannesburgso I wanted to just wear ALL THE new things! I love me a tartan tie, its very versatile as you generally have 3 or 4 colours in the tie to match to different parts of your outfit, in this case I let the neutral colours in the tie form the base and built the major items around that with a neutral jacket and trousers. I took a chance with the pocket square and lapel flower, technically they shouldnt have worked, the pocket square was a little busy, and the flowers colour ever so slightly off, but in the end it was the confidence that pulled it off. Ive always said, you can wear anything if you wear it confidently right? Maybe it was confidence combined with the fact that the colours actually all worked togetherbut who can be sure.

Now, theres nothing wrong with that, in fact blue and grey are a fine combination and personally I could (and pretty much do) have my wardrobe consisting of only those colours. Yes! Grey is a colour. Today however, I decided I would shift it all up a little, so much so that I did a Fancy Friday on a Monday morning which I usually reserve for being casual. I wanted it to be colourful and just a little loud, so of course I started with purple pants. You kinda have to really. Once you go bold though, you cant turn back, and the trick becomes adding piece after piece of pattern, texture and brightness to make sure that it all works together despite the fact that it shouldnt. In this case, I kinda decided that I was going to build the outfit around my shoes, rather than the pants. I cant seem to stop wearing these double monks they go with everything despite being a reddish oxblood colour. So in this case, the red / brown detailing in the tie, picked up on the shoes, and the red lapel flower, brought out the red in the tie more, which made it work better with the shoes. I also wanted to funk up my accessories a bit, while remaining in the same colour palette. Enter wood! Yep! Wood!

I went out outside so I could take a picture and share the fun but looking at the photo the colour of the tan isnt really that hilarious But Ive obviously posted the picture anyway, a new skin colour albeit a temporary one can always be a point of interest and Im wearing my favourite red scrunchie (bring back scrunchies!) so you can all enjoy that too. Im also wearing my token concerned face, which partly stems from being sensitive to glare and my daggy tracksuit pants and singlet from Cream, Im not going to risk anything good the tan stains and smellifys everything it touches. I read once that fake tans slowly put toxins into your blood this certainly makes it a occupational hazard for me, but I cant do the real tan thing in a Australia because the UV index is ridiculous! An example, In Thailand I can lay for an hour in the full summer sun and get a nice little bronzed shadow if I did this in Australia I would be hospitalised for burns no joke! Its a tough land for the pasty folks down here. So this leaves me asking the question to fake tan or not too fake tan? Does being bronzy mean you create a greater impact when strolling (strutting!) into a room? Should I be faking it more frequently, much to my boyfriends disgust?

There was a rollercoaster giddiness felt after the show because you were so excited to witness the rise of yet another London duckling that only added to the hub-hub over LFW (I've just added yet another shoutout of \"LFW is so great\" to the chorus of articles in the latest isssue of Pop). It was somewhat of an inevitability. Her off-schedule show had people in raptures and forevermore, the contrast between white lace trapped in kinky clear PVC stamped Rocha as someone who knows a thing or two about texture games. She didn't disappoint for her A/W 12-3 collection and refined her aesthetic even more, so much so that her MA collection seemed like a distant memory. You forget, that she's only really been four seasons in. She upped the tactability factor by looking at tribes of Papua New Guinea and then 1930s street urchin children of her native Dublin. I'm also reminded of Irish photographer Niall O'Brien's Good Rats series that depics street tribes at their most quiet and strangely beautiful. It's this mix of regal and untamed that underscores the collection. Slick mirror leather is the hard counterpart to the soft fluffy wool knit collar. A spotty print hide or sheeny shiny black ponyskin has a wildness to it that is coaxed back to elegance in a boxy oversized coat. PVC gets an burst of tufted yarns that could be likened to Papupa New Guinea tribal costume. The ladylike connotations of Melton and Linton tweed (oft used by Chanel) gets a layering of tulle to form a barrier of refinement. It's as if Rocha knows exactly when materials start looking cliched and banal and has the ability to stop them from doing so, with the wave of her texture-driven magic wand. It's this precise knack for contrast and balance that got female hearts racing in the audience. I came away wanting to dress head to toe and submerse myself completely in Rocha's work. That's a hard feat for someone who craves the mix n' match. In the shoe department, Rocha has long displayed a maturity that is beyond her years. The idea of working perspex into a brogue has the potential for becoming a design classic, as recognisable as Hussein Chalayan's wooden table skirt or Issey Miyake's Pleats Please technique. Rocha went for a pure stable of flat brogues and pumps and the perspex became a thin accent embedded in the sole, shining in clear, lime or coral. With two pairs of Simone Rocha's already in the closet, it invariably means that I'll now have to go the whole hog and continue that tradition with this season. That's no hardship considering the choice at hand.",

I suppose they could be celebratory as well, with each bouquet representing a year of Simons' tenure at Jil Sander. The final standing ovation and the tears, genuine on the part of Simons, weirdly false when it came to certain members of the audience, too contributed to the atmosphere where we felt pressurised to mourn the loss of Simons. Was I the only one that was a little giddy, feeling like this finale was brimming with possibility? Yes, it is an end of an era but it's also the beginning of an exciting trajectory of Simons' career. Wherever he goes or does will still be hugely influential to fashion, as his contribution to Jil Sander has been for the past seven years. I guess I never saw Raf Simons, as someone who was deadlocked to the brand of Jil Sander, despite the magnificent work he has done there and instead, he could well leave an influential imprint at two or three more places should he wish. Not that there I'm saying the show should have been devoid of emotion but let's tone down the dramatics and start anticipating what's around the corner Raf Simons is well and alive and has the ability to take his skill and vision and apply them to any number of houses in addition to continue doing so for his own brand (Raf Simons womenswear imagine that eh?). It is an end of sorts but also a new beginning for Simons as well as for Jil Sander, which will see the return of the brand's founder. Something else to get excited about. The collection itself was in fact a delicate continuation of what Simons has been exploring for the past three seasons exploring mid twentieth century couture through a sharply finessed looking glass. The delicacy of lingerie-inspired palette steered clear from what's going on in the rest of the season and had most of us swooning at how Simons had progressed to a point where he's comfortable with conveying ultra femininity in his work. It was difficult to get away from the Dior allusions, especially in the use of gravity defying volume, best seen in the coats that the models clutched together at the chest and in the gathers of fabric around the hip in synthesised corset dresses. If we have been reading it correctly, that Simons has been \"auditioning\" for the creative director role at Dior and if it is to be that Avenue Montaigne will indeed be his next workplace, then we can get REALLY excited about what's around the corner. Imagine some of these dresses in a Dior show. I'll stop at that wild speculation and say that I also did find myself reminiscing over some of the key moments of Simons' collections for Jil Sander the S/S 08 sunset colours, the ripped textures of S/S 10, the flat boots and short shift dresses proposed in A/W 10-11 and then the onslaught of stellar collections from S/S 11 to S/S 12. These collections filtered down to real shifts in the way women dressed and there is no doubt that Simons will continue creating these shifts. This show wasn't an adieu, but an au revoir, as in we'll be seeing Simons again.",

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-10 Bowlin It Grazia got the big reveal this week on the full Mary Katrantzou for Topshop collection and now the images will most likely spread wildfire in a similar fashion to the bowl dress that was somewhat leaked back in October. The incredulous reaction isn't of course over the fact that Mary Katrantzou has done a collaboration for Topshop but that it is so full and rich and in someways ever closer to her mainline collection. I got to roadtest the collection a couple weeks ago but due to a technical glitch with my SD card, the only pics that I have are of the stand out bowl dress. That's somewhat fitting seeing as it is the piece that got me incredibly excited initially, and the bulk of the pics I did here were about getting that extreme shape and saturated colour and print out into the \"real world\" of N7 in Holloway and dressing it down so that it seems that the bowl skirt with gold fish swimming around on it, feels like the most natural thing in the world. Which it was. Nobody batted an eyelid, other than at the fact that I was bare legged on a freezing day. It was a perfect pitch of exhuberance that is exactly the sort of outfit you'd want to retaliate against the grey and the mundane. The 350 price tag is either scarily good or just scary depending on your point of view. I'm going with scarily good given that Mary Katrantzou's mainline dresses do run into five figures. What's better was that this well-shot, well-worn sample had all the neat finishing, print placement and construction, that I'd expect from Topshop's higher-rung collabs (in line with what David Koma did for toppers). The technical glitch might have resulted in a post entirely focused on this bowl dress but looking at the other pieces the printed satin trousers, the slubby tees, the buttoned up chiffon shirts and leggings they're all no-brainer print-on-print pieces. It's the sort of stuff where you'd want to buy two or more pieces so that they're naturally go together in a sea of florals that are very distinctly Katrantzou, despite their casual shapes. Apologies if I've subliminally or not-so subliminally sent out the message that everyone needs a satin bowl shaped dress adorned with flora and fish in their lives. Look into my eyes, look into my eyes get yourself bowled up come February 17th when the collection drops. (Worn with vintage gem-encrusted jacket, Mother of Pearl navy leather parka, Monki floral parka and Prada pink jumper, J.W. Anderson bearded shoes throughout)",

You know how I like nice and slow, taking my time, chillaxing with showroom visits and then unleashing them slowly with oozy motion. Hmmm am I talking about fashion shows? Beware. When one wakes up at 5am every day from relentless jet lag, words like \"ooze\" and \"chillaxing\" leave the keyboard. I'm going to be knuckling down throughout the day in the spare hours to quickly catch up but for now, here's a little catty something something. A pair of \"Va Va\" Karen Walker sunglasses together with an Opening Ceremony x Glamour (a weird collaboration that reads like yoghurt and marmite but somehow works) cat eye sweater that has been doing the street style rounds gave me super charged cat power. Not the persona or the singer alas, but the type of cat power that gives me the strength to zip around shows, not feel the increasingly abrasive cold and also answer interview questions about Downton Abbey (I LOVE the fact that Downton has gone Stateside and that I'm suddenly the token British spokesperson to talk about it in fashion interviews). In addition to the cat power, I've pulled another Topshop shocker. Meaning I wore something from Topshop and people go \"No? Really? Topshop?!?\" This Topshop Boutique skirt and matching bomber jacket are poofy in all the right places and features a nubbly graphic weave in the polyester that makes you think polyester is actually incredible as a fabric. To top it all off, these Simone Rocha wedges got a proper trial. Walkability? A half an hour walk and they start hurting a little but err shamfully, I get to zip around in a Range Rover Evoque for the week, so I get to practise the art of swinging your legs elegantly out of a car without looking like a tangle of limbs.

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-08 Charlottes Web >> I remember getting closet envy over people who could catalogue their shoes with a Polaroid shot tacked on to each box. It seemed like a grudgingly appealing decadence to be able to go through endless packs of Polaroid film as well as afford yourself a good amount of space for said shoe closet. Now with Polaroids in short supply unless you buy eBay deadstock (Impossible Project's substitute film seems to constantly overexpose the shots anyone else with the same problem?) and the fact that I tend to want to grab my shoes without getting them out of the box, that dream of Polaroid shoe storage isn't as potent as it once seemed. Charlotte Olympia has solved half that problem. From S/S 12 onwards, every pair of her shoes will come with a Polaroid snapshot that has a self-adhesive back for you to pop it on to the box. Amongst my rabble jumble of shoes where I do sacrilegious things such as stacking heels on top of one another, this Charlotte Olympia box can be the sole shining example of shoe keeping etiquette. The lonesome Polaroid snap would also spur me on to photograph and document the rest of my wardrobe for posterity's sake. At the very least, even if Olympia doesn't start a sticky Polaroid shoebox revolution, inside her immaculate boxes still lies a pair of her charm-heavy shoes. From fruit salads to tropical flowers to cat's ears, it's hard not to have that cutesey \"Awwwwwwwww\" reaction when faced with Olympia's shoes. These velvet flats with an embroidered web (Charlotte's Web, geddit?) and a teensy tiny spider are no exception. I'm also glad Olympia favours her flats with a slight 1cm heel, the type that makes Salvatore Ferragamo Vara pumps so walkable. Charlotte's Web shoes available from stockists and her website in March.",

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-27 Clompin Around >> I think I seriously offended certain Milanese people with my Six London shoes, which I wore yesterday in this neon n' beige outfit cobbled together from Yoox finds. There were real detectable looks from people, which combined shock, bemusement and revulsion, on a day when the city was rammed with Venetian carnival partakers wearing masks, costumes and tossing confetti about. Oh well, trust the fashion carnival to try and usurp the bigger picture as though we were the centre of everyone's attention (ludicrously, I did overhear a fashion show goer say \"Oh my god, don't the Milanese know it's FASHION WEEK?\"). I can't say that I'm able to go about town discreetly wearing these fluoro bad boys but at the very least I can comfortably walk to and from appointments easily, whilst carrying with me a whole lotta platform. There was supposed to be some deep and meaningful analogy between the two different carnivals but once again, I'm on the road back to London for a day before heading out to Paris so hopefully you know the score and realise this is in fact a gratuitous piccy post to say that I'm alive, clomping about merrily and eating a lot of gelato along the way.

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-24 Cornered It seems like an odd thing to have flown into Milan and on the first day, post about what is essentially a young designer initiative. I do still have a flood of NYFW/LFW stuff to go up but all in due course. First up is a call to action by Vogue Italia and The Corner who have teamed up to present the second edition of a group of eleven designers, all given editorial and prime e-commerce positioning. Yoox Group's collaboration activites are numerous and for some reason, generally slips by unnoticed, without creating too much of a fanfare. The Vogue Talents Corner project was feted last night with all eleven designers displaying their S/S 12 pieces, which are currently available to buy on The Corner and then a small preview of their A/W 12-3 collection, ready for me to get stuck into discovering. Some of the names were new to me and some were familiar and thankfully all formed a potent selection that was splendidly varied. The Corner is probably one of the big e-commerce power players that does tend to go for a more directional buy in terms of its stock and so adding these eleven designers to the site feels fairly seamless. As Federico Marchetti, founder and CEO of Yoox Group pointed out, The Corner is there to take risks and for these eleven designers, hopefully the risk pays off. Mungo Gurney Yes, that is the designer's actual name and no, I stupidly didn't ask him where it came from. I did glean that Mungo is only one collection in and already the S/S 12 collection is in Browns Focus, Luisa Viaroma, No.6 in New York and now The Corner. His collection is primarily print focused with an emphasis on vibrantly colour blocked swimwear. His sophomore A/W 12-3 collection is still fairly print focused but the colours are slightly more muted and detailed. He'll be doing an event to properly present the whole collection back in London after fashion week so I'll hopefully get the chance to ask him what exactly is the deal with his name. A/W 12-3 S/S12: C.B. Made in Italy Cecilia Bringheli isn't the only brand doing slippers but her's are especially well crafted, made in a small factory in Northern Italy and designed to ensure maximum comfort for the wearer. She chooses her patterns and prints wisely and a pair adorned with a watercolour floral from the S/S 12 collection are particularly fetching. Tweeds, checks and wools dominate her A/W 12-3 crop of slippers but it's these richly hued suede ankle boots that look mighty appealing. A/W 12-3: S/S 12: Leitmotif I became familiar with Fabio Sasso and Juan Caro's work through their menswear collections at Pitti. I predictably fell for their prints that combined baroque and gothic inspired patterns, lifting and collaging them into imaginary landscapes. Incidentally, they've become my go to answer whenever people quiz me about up and coming designers based in Italy. Their S/S 12 collection is a riotous trip that is saved by the fairly simple shapes. A/W 12-3: S/S 12: AI_Andrea Incontri I already wrote about AI's S/S 12 collection of odd uniformity and it's pleasing to see some of those pieces on TheCorner. What started off as a disciplined accessories label only recently forayed into simple garments. AI has now shifted into adding one wardrobe cornerstone at a time first the bag, then the cotton t-shirt and now the coat which were made in collaboration with Hapsburg, in a project that explored the shade of loden. Speckled leathers that look like stingray sparkle their way on to little pouches and wristlet bags and then on to shoes, another new addition. A/W 12-3: S/S 12: Hexa by Kuho I've attended a few of Korean-born designer Kuho Jung's shows in New York and S/S 12 was by far my favourite one with his unusual fixation on Russian military badges. In what was a fairly minimal and precise collection, a splay of badges came bursting forth and was visually appealing in a weirdly literal sort of way. Vernissage You might be sick of animalia gracing jewellery but Illenia Corti and Matteo Mena don't look at the obvious species of the animal world to focus on. They sit somewhere between fine and costume jewellery, applying the principles of handcrafted, non-identikit way of working to their pieces. Everything has a precious antiqued look to it and yet there's a playfulness to pieces like the firefly ring and earrings which actually have movable wings. A/W 12-3: S/S 12: Benedetta Bruzziches The one and only pure bag label in the mix was definitely intriguing. The chesterfield inspired quilted bags looked at first like a witty take on the Chanel 2.55 but then in other parts of the collection, you have a fox head winking back at you as well as a chalk paper shopping bag complete with a to-buy list written on the side. It's hard to see what exactly is Bruzziches' bag niche but perhaps she's still finding that out herself. A/W 12-3: S/S 12: Joanne Stoker This ex-architect turned shoe designer twinkled her way into my life when I saw her beautiful, completely NON-gimmicky shoes that have LED lights in the heels. This Cordwainers graduate impresses in her other designs that mix up unusual resinned inlays with a plainer upper. This is clever shoe collaging with stunning effects. I feel a post coming on titled \"Stoked with Stoker\" as I'm sure to revisit her work soon enough. A/W 12-3: S/S 12: Ricostru Hurrah! I score my first Guangzhou-based designer by way of Riko Manchit Au, whose label Ricostru (from the Italian word for reconstruction), seeks to readdress refined basics for the women, whilst maintaining a low carbon footprint. I got to converse in a few words of Cantonese and also find that Ricostru actually already has its own boutique in Shanghai. I also got to see the jewellery by Rosalyn Citta Paramitha, a friend of Au's with whom she studied at the Institute of Marangoni. These sculpted metal shards go hand in hand with the pure lines of the Ricostru pieces. Pedro Lourenco This young Brazilian designer needs little introduction as he bravely burst on to the Paris calendar a few seasons ago and is in fact, currently preparing for his proper A/W 12-3 show. I think his pre fall collection is probably his most mature yet where glacier prints are spliced into knit dresses and wool coats are subtly dyed to look like frost had bit into the shades of blue and peach. The tricksy pieces from his S/S 12 collection are perhaps not a true reflection of where Lourenco is at now, design-wise but we shall see in about a week's time. Pre-fall 2012: S/S 12: Shourouk Shourouk's jewellery instantly caught the eye of details maven Tommy Ton, who would probably have a ball shooting some of these pieces. This Parisian-based jeweller honed her skills at Galliano and Chloe before starting out on her own and progressively becoming more daring with the composition of her bling-heavy pieces. For A/W 12-3, she has ventured into pinked edged handbags which equally get a heavy dose of paste and sparkle that are prompting the magpie in me to hope that TheCorner will continue to support her work.

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-02 Culinary Comforts Within a single Stockholm Fashion Week, I got to talk to not one but TWO designers about food. DOUBLE SCORE! First it was Carin Wester's abstracted Parisians bistros and brasseries and then yesterday, I began at Mathias Dahlgren's Matbaren where Rodebjer presented their A/W 12-3 collection and ended the day, with a meal at that very same establishment, eating pig's head and pickled cucumber. A fitting end to a trip where keeping warm, seeing warmth-inducing collections and good food has gone hand in hand with each other. There was a reason why Carin Rodebjer chose that venue to show her collection. She spoke of relating to Dahlgren, drawing parallels between his harmonious food creations and her own attitude towards the sort of women that command her clothes rather than the other way round. It's with this notion in mind that she thought of men's fashion icons such as David Hockney, Jean Cocteau and Prince Michael Duke of Kent for her new collection. It wasn't that she wanted to inject menswear dress codes into the collection but it's more about the attitude and the ease with which these men inhabit their clothes that she brought to her clothes. In general, that is the raison d'tre of all Rodebjer collections but there was definitely something luxuriously comforting about the recipe that she had cooked up in Dahlgren's premises, all of which instantly looked like go-to-staples a knee length kimono coat with arm patches, the sweaters and skirts in a texturised faux fur that from a distance looked like crushed velvet, the idea of layering up two polo necks (thanks Carin I'm shamelessly nicking that idea to keep my neck warm in New York) and a wrapped shirt printed with garden blooms. Accessories such as the flat leather slip-ons and the A3 sized clutches (suggesting that it might hold something more substantial than a lippie and a phone) were the perfect ingredients to complete this succinctly edited wardrobe. I know it sounds like a bit of a la-di-da drone, but editing does seem to be a problem at Stockholm shows. There's no need to hammer home the point by showing EVERY single style in EVERY possible colour way. Rodebjer did no such thing. Actually, I left the show wanting more. Fortunately, Rodebjer has support from the likes of bStore in London and a very well-stocked webstore of their own. Hopefully the reality of wearing this collection feels every bit as good as my meal did at Matbaren. Steve's iPhone pics are my one boshed attempt at throwing in my secondary passion here.

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-07 Delicate Shell Vauxhall Fashion Scout's Ones to Watch show will be my first stop at London Fashion Week and out of the line-up, Myrza de Muynck is already the one that's getting my heart a-fluttering. Does the heart flutter over clothes? It does when faced with Muynck's charm, which came in mega doses when I visited her studio. Four interns quietly sewing away something vaguely old (Dusty Springfield perhaps?) on the radio and the room awash with dainty pastel embroidery and beading. Then you delve into the pieces in tandem with Myrza's drawings and the fluttering begins. Perhaps this won't affect anyone who doesn't have a strange love/hate relationship with the shell suit. Hey we've all worn one. My sister and I have been subjected to some truly hideous matching shell suits (she wore pink, I wore blue) together with our parents who also wore shell suits (mum wore white, dad wore navy) and out on holiday we would go because of course, you can only get the most our of your surroundings if you have a shell suit on. I perversely liked the uniformity though. I enjoyed \"dressing up\" for sports/leisure activities whilst not partaking in any err actual sports or leisure. The shell suit does however come loaded with a lot of naff baggage, too numerous to even list out here because I'm sure everyone will have their own set of iconic negative imagery, associated with this 80s relic. Well, Myrza has set about overturning those connotations. From her MA collection at Central Saint Martins through to her S/S 12 collection and now to the one she's working on for Vauxhall Fashion Scout, the idea of contrasting sportswear influenced shapes and pretty-pretty embellishment has been a solid foundation. With a collaged-in-muse in mind (a young Jodie Foster pops up from time to time), she starts off with impressionistic drawings that then develops into beading or embroidery sampling. Myrza purposely strings together beads and stitches with a naivete which sounds obnoxious but is utterly charming when you see the work upclose. It's not wonky for wonky's sake. The finishing of the garments themselves is immaculate but then the hand dying and embellishments takes a slightly more rough-hewed course that works in Myrza's favour. After all a shell suit can't be spruced up to the point where it becomes entirely unrecognisable or TOO luxurious for its own good. Therefore, the slightly awkward undertones that permeate Myrza's drawings and handiwork gives her clothes a tangible reality. You can tell I desperately want to scuzz about Holloway Road wearing a head to toe Myrza look. It's hard not to fall into cliched romanticisation of 'urban grittiness' and I suppose Myrza's shell suits are a manifestation of that. I got to see some of the preliminary sketches and embroidery experimentations for the new collection which is more or less a continuation of the sort of shapes and colours that Myrza has been exploring previously with a few added textures of towelling, crochet and drawn on illustrations to go with the beading and embroidery. I don't normally go into detail posting past collections but the nature of Myrza's drawings along with her reference imagery and then the pieces themselves make it impossible not to go into picture overload. Here are both her S/S 12 and her MA collection which are again, a continuous run of silhouettes where delicate handcrafted prettiness meets comfort and practicality. I was trying to put my finger on what was so special about the styling of Emma Watson on the cover for Elle UK in the November issue last year and along with unexpected appearance of Tsumori Chisato, Myrza's trackie top here also featured on the cover a brave choice when that prime clothing credit could have gone to a shot-to-death advertiser.",

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-17 Dont be Touchin Ma Manolos Travel-induced illness bogs me down again and NYFW now quickly turns to LFW. But, first a bit of fashion week respite with a unique collaboration from a veritable legend. Manolo Blahnik's entry into 21st century cultural lexicon is such that it's often quite difficult to focus on what are still meticulously crafted and ultimately beautiful shoes without thinking of Carrie \"I couldn't help but wonder\" Bradshaw and her affectation for her Manolos. I can't even say Manolos without doing a really lame neck roll movement. Kind of like when I say \"OH no you DID'NT!\" and then people give me a strange look because of my mild-mannered British accent. However, I can't deny that the shoe collaborations that stood out at NYFW include Sophie Theallet's rich tri-coloured heeled oxfords and Dean Quinn's elegant ankle strap flats both were less about angular or architectural shapes but more about a distinctive artistic take on recognisable classics. Lane Crawford quite rightly fetes the shoe designer's 40th anniversary, with a series of celebratory events, collaborations and product revivals. The department store's ifc store in Hong Kong has been transformed into a Manolo shrine with sketches, personal artefacts and archive collections. If only I was there to show everyone my head wiggling skills. To illustrate the savour faire displayed by, Blahnik's shoes, various motifs, sketches and even food handpicked by Blahnik himself have made their way into collaborated products. The stripe from an archive shoe has been transplanted onto some beautiful Causse Gantier gloves as well as Globetrotter luggage. Globetrotter's collaborated luggage has always made me quiver a bit. They are wholly unpractical and their carry-on-only capability is probably precisely what I love about them (apparently they get really fucked up if you check them in). The stationer Connor have done a range of note cards and pads engraved with a shoe sketch and Olmetto have done a collection of silk scarves printed with shoe sketches. I gussied up this airport food court chair with the scarf and stationery whilst munching on a McDonalds hash brown. Classy. What's more exciting are the reissued archive shoes that span Blahnik's storied career. More recognisable styles include the J-Lo endorsed caterpillar boot which spawned a million copies. More pleasingly obscure styles include the Christopher Kane S/S 08 collaboration, where denim meets silver toe caps in an ankle boot, that suddenly feels current again. The combination of a then-up-and-coming designer with bravado and Blahnik's dedication to craftsmanship is a winning one. Then there are older archive pieces such as a pair of pumps inspired by Piet Mondrian and a pair of striped sandals inspired by Anna Piaggi, which doesn't even look like it belongs to its 70s origins. I've personally not yet got on board the Manolo train but these revived classics may well be an apt starting point.",

The truth is, Milan is my most easy going week of all. It's the one where I'm not bogged down with writing for other people nor do I have to go traipsing around seeing advertiser after advertiser in an appointment haul. What then happens is that I turn into a Sophie Kinsella type character and start hounding people about information on discounts, outlet stores and wander about town with a giant phone (yes, I'm stuck on the Samsung Galaxy Note, and yes, it does make me look a little like that character from Trigger Happy TV), looking up addresses and come back to the hotel laden with bags. I had an outer body experience of looking down on this dippy, ditzy self when a journalist was interviewing me back in New York about how I shop and I got really excited talking about the wonders of Yoox, eBay, Battersea car boot sale and vintage shopping at Alfie's, more so than when people ask me about what I think about the trends of the season (most ridiculous on the spot question this season thus far FYI is \"Why do I think French women are so chic and can we got the look of chic French women?\" errr). My eyes literally light up as I natter on about spending two hours looking at things on Yoox and combing through the Opening Ceremony sale. It's a malaise that I'm well aware of but don't seem to be able to curb, so long as I'm obsessed with the idea of NOT paying top dollar/pound/euro for anything I buy. This outfit is therefore the result of the side of me that turns into a candy floss piece of shopping fluff. When you're wrenching out Balenciaga pre-fall outside, whilst loudly exclaiming how much discount I got off as though you had haggled a cheap piece of meat at the butchers, you know that the dizzie shopping bug has well and truly rotted its way through. I'm simultaneously ashamed and pleased that I bagged these pre-fall 2011 quilted trousers that have William Morris-esque florals running up and down them, a plasticised white skirt from the S/S 11 collectionand a Balenciaga menswear cable knit jumper that looks like it has been hit with a dose of grey ash. I'm laying the blame with Avril Mair from British Elle and Caroline Issa from Tank magazine as they pointed me to the sources of the items, which were thD Magazinestore and the 10 Corso Como outlet shop. Just a few more addresses to add to the ever bulging shopping directory I carry in my head to enthuse about in future airy fairy interviews.

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-26 Impossible Conversations >> I never seem to be able to make it to the Met Museum in New York to catch their annual fashion exhibition biggie as it is normally timed in between fashion weeks. I very nearly spanked a ton of air miles on a ticket just to see the McQueen exhibition last year but then decided that mother Lau might want to make it to the USA one day, so I'd better save them up for a rainy day. A preview event of the upcoming Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations exhibition has wetted the appetite and may just be the primary excuse for a random trip to NY come May. The reasoning for pitting Miuccia Prada against Elsa Schiaparelli was fairly logical both are female, Italian and both questioned the notions of good taste in their time. What stumped me was how the exhibition would be presented and how the two designers' work would interact with each other. That question was duly answered at the preview as Harold Koda and Andrew Bolton, the curators at The Costume Institute thoroughly explained the outline of the exhibition alongside a few working examples of Prada and Schiaparelli pieces. The parallels between the work were actually far more literal than I thought they'd be. A baroque swirl on a 1937 Schiaparelli jacket matched up with another more recognisable bit of baroque on a Prada S/S 11 dress. The use of art nouveau patterns in Prada's S/S 08 looking uncannily like Schiaparelli's 1937-8 ensemble. What's more interesting is that it's unlikely that Miuccia ever took conscious and direct influence from Schiaparelli's work. The seven thematic themes will include Hard Chic, Ugly Chic, Naif Chic, The Classical Body, The Exotic Body and The Surreal Body. The mere fact that an exhibition includes a section entitled Ugly Chic is worth the plane ticket for me to go and take a peek and I'm glad that the curators have addressed the bravery of both designers to question sanctioned chicness. Koda recounted a little anecdote about Schiaparelli admonishing someone for making fun of her mismatched shoes by saying \"You wouldn't know chic if it hit you on the head!\" The exhibition will also explore the distinct differences between the two women in the theme \"Waist Up/Waist Down\" with Schiaparelli gravitating towards ostentatious jackets and Prada maintaining a preference for skirts. This is quite evident in these paired up examples here that the Met provided. Whilst there are uniting features in these pairings, it's also clear that the two designers' aesthetic and process poles apart. What's more intriguing will be the videos directed by Baz Luhrmann where simulated conversations between Schiaparelli and Prada take place. The situation is of course fictitious but the words will be taken from Schiaparelli's biography and interviews that Prada has done. I can't quite visualise this part of this namesake part of the exhibition so there's really only one way of finding out how this dead and alive convo is constructed.

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-21 Into the Woods If I've hit the snooze button on posting, I promise there is good reason but I was waiting for something mammoth and this was exactly that. Hopefully some of you tuned in to the stream of McQ's show last night but I know how easy it is to forget to time into a live stream so I'm hoping that you'll relish in the palpitating moments backstage before, what I thought was one of the most memorable shows I've seen in a LONG time. The excacerbated excited tingling may have been caused by the sheer opportunity that I got to go backstage in what was a fairly tight and closed set. Still, given that one of the first things that I saw when I walked in backstage was Kristen McMenamy stalking around demi-dressed in a robe and a skintight tulle top with velvet appliqued leaves, with an exaggerated coil of hair atop her head, I think exclamation mark laden excitement is well and truly called for. Let's put this McQ show into context first and foremost. It is the first time Alexander McQueen's diffusion line McQ has ever had a show. It's been about ten years since Alexander McQueen the brand has staged any sort of show in London. McQ the diffusion line, launched back in 2006 has been a dritfting label of the uber casual and denim-based offerings with a few teensy tiny hints to McQueen's house codes. Sarah Burton has now taken hold of the McQ ship to steer it into a new era, where the collection would slide up the scale, closer to the mainline and a four storey McQ store set to open in London will galvanise that shift. People on the livestream, who thought they were tuning into a proper Alexander McQueen show would be forgiven for thinking this was slightly minimal for a mainline McQueen show, when in fact this was actually a stellar McQ collection. I was well and truly floored when I saw the clothes on the rack and the collection pretty much had me when I saw McMenamy, looking hauntingly beautiful from very angle. The final three looks with their nipped in waists and hard-edged delicacy were already a million steps up from what McQ had offered previously. If the main Alexander McQueen is about as close to haute couture as can be expected in a ready to wear line, then McQ surely had to follow suit to present itself as a collection that takes those fantastical elements and tone them down for the reality of daily wear. There wasn't a checked shirt or parka jacket in sight and yet the distinction between the two lines is testament to how intricate and artisinal Sarah Burton's work is for the mainline. McQ's clothes still looked exquisitely made but neither were they the magnificent feats of intense labour that Burton pours into say a ruffled dress made up of hundreds of circular hand massaged chiffon. For the new customer that has recently been made aware of Alexander McQueen as a brand, due to last year's festivities, McQ will present itself as a better opportunity to be within touching distance of \"proper\" McQueen. Let's talk about THAT hair first. I'm not the best at covering beauty and hair backstage and I was definitely trying to pick up tips from the hordes hair and beauty journos. Overhearing their convo with Guido Palau, who created this incredible feat of hair manipulation, I gleaned that the look was supposed to be an exaggerated 1940s hair roll, made up of a giant hair doughnut with the model's real hair pulled up over it, which looked like a painful process. I did want to tap Guido's shoulder and say \"Hey, you remember me? You didn't want to do my hair on that Gap Christmas ad campaign because you said it looked fine as it was and I had sad panda face all day because of that.\" That would be incredibly sad and dorky though so I resisted the temptation. The boots were also an arduous process. Thigh high with dozens of eyelets, the lacing up took about three people per model to complete. They are incidentally the first pair of thigh highs that I've wanted in a long time, which I think has something to do with the shine of the leather and the brogue-like punched detailing. When they practised the finale, which hopefully you'll get to see in its mighty glory once McQ put up the full video, I was pretty hysterical. That's when I started manically tweeting \"Please, guys. Just watch this.\" It was really hard not to overdose on shots of McMenamy and her closing look. As for the rest of the collection, it ran the gamut from the pragmatic and slick military moss green coats and jackets to the fantasy of a tutu dress embroidered with flowers. Everything was waisted and tightened to the proportions that one expects from McQueen. The Black Watch tartan was more than a nod to the notorious Highland Rape collection and has actually featured in previous McQ collections but looks more polished here as a bustier dress over a lace top or as a dramatic flared out frock coat. The menswear was perhaps slightly erring on the more casual side when compared with the womenswear but that didn't lessen the direction of the show which was WWII military in spirit to begin with and then darkened into a tangible woodland fantasy where burgandy velvet devorwith leaf motifs, a rainbow cornucopia of fabric flowers and cut silk and knots of silk made to look like moss growing on a rock all take over. The finale, as some of you will have seen, featured McMenamy emerging on to the dried leaf covered catwalk and standing there, illuminated like a Titania-esque statue with leaves falling from above. She then looks up bewildered and lost and finds nestled under the leaves, a rope that guides her to a dramatic reveal of a woodland scene and into a curious looking hut. Then there's an unexpected blaring of techno from this hidden club, to which we were all invited in to (provided you can elbow your way in through the throng of guests) afterwards for a drink or two with McMenamy revelling in all the photo snapping and looking like she owned this joint called the Core Club. According to the receipts plastered all over the walls, there are a ton of lifetime members, perhaps an allusion to the lifelong dedicated fans of Alexander McQueen, both brand and person. That's a Core Club that you can happily sign me up to.",

I've not been all that diligent with snapping my outfits because of all the rushing around and yesterday, the only real quiet moment I had was at the Chris Benz presentation at the Lincoln Center where the lovely Rachel Scroggins very kindly did the photographing honours. There's nothing here that you've not seen before except that I was trialling the tucking in of the hair inside a white poloneck a Celine A/W 11-12. I'm not sure how successful it was as the abundance of hair kept on trying to escape out of its white poloneck trap. (Suno jacket, Peter Jensen lurex sweaters, Christopher Kane white shirt, Uniqlo white heat tech poloneck underneath, Miu Miu x Pop shoes, Theyskens Theory bag) On another outfit note, Grazia recently shot me for their bi-annual bumper fashion issue which is about three times bigger than the normal weekly dose. The issue will be out during London Fashion Week and in addition, they've created lots of little vids in the run-up to the launch of the issue, including a little vid of our shoot. Phil Taylor was shooting and the lovely Hannah Almassi was doing all the organising. I salute whoever came up with the idea of getting readers to decide what I wear on the first day of London Fashion Week. It's not a complete free rein as I picked all the outfits but hey, it is a bit of interactive fun that is mind fluffingly easy. So we have a J.W. Anderson ensemble, a Leutton Postle jumper and a Miu Miu skirt, a Louise Gray crop top and skirt and a Christopher Kane dress with a vintage kimono. See? I'm not exactly laying out a nasty fate for myself so I'm happy to have you guys do the choosing for me. Vote here on Grazia Daily via their comments or Twitter.",

Our destination? First up, BFC's Rock Vault where the best of London's directional fine jewellery designer was showcased. Then on to Sister by Sibling's first proper presentation in the Portico Rooms. Sister by Sibling is into its second season and the autumn winter season definitely gave the knitwear label a far more surer footing. This trio of Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery weren't afraid to remix previous motifs from their menswear offering and kapowow us with loud-as-you-can-shout colour combinations. Katie Grand's more-is-more styling helped to amplify what Sibling is all about which is the idea of maintaining classic knitwear shapes but applying the most unlikely patterns to them. A twin set, nay a tri-set of cardigan, crewneck and vest in highlighter orange leopard print and electric pink and blue Fair Isle would please both the zany granny and the out there club kid as well as a lot of people in between who might take one piece or two. A knitted faux fur fox stole is another witty knit touch that makes Sibling all the more lovable. What really hit the spot for me were the sequinned knit jumper and skirts as well as the pom pom adorned skull face, another way of subverting this oft-used badge of rebellion. Lurex, angora and mohair knits in a similar palette are the more simple foundations of this collection but I think they really need to have the leopard jostling alongside them in order to be a true Sister by Sibling soldier, which is exactly who I wanted to be after seeing the presentation. A collaboration with Underground, who have done a few shoe collabs this season, means that we get to wear Sibling's Fair Isle knit on pointy creepers as well as an orange leopard print chelsea boots, both likely to go into production. A less likely collaboration sees Sibling giving Barbie six of their key looks from the collection and frankly, she's never looked cooler.",

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-09 Louis Vuitton: The Secret (and not so secret) Places I'm quite tickled with the fact that my fashion month has been given a sense of symmetry courtesy of Louis Vuitton, who invited me out yesterday to Paris to discover a few \"secret places\" which is succinctly summarised in the video above, unlike this beast of a post that I'm typing up at 3am after freshly landing in New York. So it is to be that Louis Vuitton will both kickstart and conclude my fashion month as of course in a month's time, in Paris in a month's time there'll be another show extravaganza as well as the opening of the new Louis Vuitton Marc Jacobs exhibition. A dusting of snow and a stunning view from the Ritz is just the sort of insanely picturesque start that this month needs. .. The craftsmanship and heritage aspects of Louis Vuitton aren't things that are necessarily sidelined. In fact, they're at the forefront of Louis Vuitton's marketing and advertising campaigns at times. Remember the ad featuring a woman hand stitching a bag that got banned in the UK? I personally never felt like the ad was wholly deceptive and rather, it was pointing out that there are in fact \"petites mains\" involved in the hundred stage process of constructing a Louis Vuitton bag or trunk. Now that I've witnessed these hands at work, I'm even more convinced that the ad didn't deserve to be banned. Despite that ad glitch, the concept of savoir faire has never been more spotlit than it is now, what with Louis Vuitton's newly relaunched website that features languid videos honing in on the intricacies of process. Specifically for Louis Vuitton, this shift in spotlighting craftsmanship is a retaliation against the counterfeit behemoth that they face. Cynically, you could also say that it is part of the rise of exposing what goes on behind the scenes as a marketing strategy, something which I've defended in the past. I reiterate here as long as the show of craftsmanship is a genuine one, I see nothing wrong in how brands divulge that information. On a more personal level, my relationship with Louis Vuitton on this blog has been needlessly fractious. From a Along with Kristin of The Clothes Whisperer, we ventured out to the Parisian suburb Asnires, where Louis Vuitton set up his workshop in 1859. Until 1977, the Asnires workshop was actually the sole Louis Vuitton production facility in the world. Louis Vuitton also added two pretty brickwork houses by the workshop, which were then lived by subsequent generations of the Vuitton family. Somewhere in this pic, three generations of the Vuitton family are present Louis Vuitton, his son Georges and his son Gaston, who I believe is lying on the famous fold-out bed-in-a-trunk. The only well-distributed and recognisable imagery of designer's houses/apartments are that of Coco Chanel. A good number of bloggers, journalists and guests have now frequented the famous apartment on Rue Cambon. This isn't the case for the Vuitton family home in Asnires (although I have to cite Bag Snob, who did visit the site two years ago) so it was such a delight to step into a reception room bathed in natural light, beautiful Art Nouveau curves and to discover an individualistic decor that was outrageous at the time, but became outmoded rather quickly. Within this beautifully preserved Belle Epoque room, features like the pistachio naturalistic curls and peach hued florals look fresh and exciting again. The stained glass windows done by Paul-Louis Janin in 1900 are particularly stunning. Not sure if LVMH have the power to command natural light but the day was pretty much spot-on weather wise in terms of seeing this room at its best situ. A note about the monogram, hardcore Louis Vuitton-ers will know that it wasn't actually created by Louis Vuitton nor was it the first bit of LV insignia. The checked Damier print actually came first and then to prevent counterfeiting (oh the irony), Georges Louis came up with the monogram in 1896. The blue ceramic fireplace was also another strong feature in the room. At this point, the inner Antiques Roadshow geek was coming out and I started to run my hands over things, whilst nearly passing ridiculous comments on how good the condition was. The same can be said for this marquetry bureau. I might need to learn some print clashing skills off it as I counted at least ten different geometric patterns, all created by intricate wood marquetry. Our guide pointed out the faint similarities between some of the marquetry and the LV monogram, which could well have been a source of inspiration for the final iconic monogram pattern. I also nearly started saying things like \"Oooh! That's a lovely period feature\", in manner of picky house hunters in London, who want period features but don't actually know what erm period they mean. The fluidity of the plaster stucco work gave the room a sense of movement and honestly, without wanting to sound like I'm gushing, when the light came in, it was pretty magical. The little semi-circles in the stained glass windows apparently enabled taskmaster Vuitton to oversee his workers in the workshop across from the house without them being able to look inside the house. Here, Marc Jacobs is pictured with Patrick Vuitton, Louis Vuitton's great, great grandson, who now heads up the workshop in Asnires, creating special orders for customers. We then went up inside the little travel museum, which has some of Vuittons' earliest flat trunk specimens. It seems silly now that a flat top and bottomed trunk could be considered an innovation in travel but in fact, all trunks beforehand came with a rounded top (to allow for water run-off). The museum neatly sums up the various patternations that Louis Vuitton and his son created the brown and white stripe, the Damier check and then the famous monogram. Another example of Oriental marquetry (I'm using the word in the stylistic sense) again reasserts an inspiration link to the inception of the monogram. This early steamer bag with its tricolor logo was recently revived and lifted as inspiration by Kim Jones in his S/S 12 debut for Louis Vuitton menswear. It says a lot that as I apparoched this bit in the museum, I said \"It's the famous packaway bed!\". It seems unlikely that a creaky old pack-away bed has become an iconic Louis Vuitton archive image, due to it being widely seen in various touring exhibitions. I suppose it sums up the assertion that Louis Vuitton has and still is essentially a business based on travel, a practical point that sometimes gets lost when we think of Louis Vuitton and its hype-built shows, campaigns and luxurious image. .. After the tour of the house, we then ventured into the atelier, which has been downscaled from what it once was, as it now concentrates on making all the hard framed luggage, special order pieces, exotic leather bags as well as the fashion show bags. I'm pleased to say though that in another part of, Asnires Louis Vuitton are training up a new generation of people to work at Louis Vuitton's atelier, something that I vehemently believe in and support. This workshop makes 250 special items or so a year which doesn't sound like a lot but the demand has never been higher and the dedication and time that each object requires hasn't diminished either, and so the need for new blood to come through the workshop is rightfully being addressed. There was a bit of a strict policy with photographing and as the workers were also finishing up (they clock off VERY promptly at 5), I couldn't get the full scope of images that I normally do when I go to a factory/workshop. Sadly, I couldn't follow the make of a bag from beginning to end but I guess it's testament to how many processes there are involved in the making of a bag, that I couldn't even physically follow their every single move with my camera. Here, carpenters are constructing the foundation boxes made out of popular and reinforced with beechwood as the basis of the luggage. I love these handwritten dimensions, passed down from Vuitton's instructions, which haven't actually changed that much. In the warm leather storage area, we got a feel for all the supple lush skins that Louis Vuitton get in for their bags and for future styles, it looks to be extremely colourful. The Epi leather is probably my favourite 'iconic' Louis Vuitton leathers/finishes just because its patina is so subtle yet immediately recognisable at the same time. Here's a stack of that nude leather that is used to make the handles, the straps and the trims of a lot of Louis Vuitton bags. This was one of the \"fake\" rules that I learnt about Louis Vuitton bag back that if it's a fake, the nude leather won't colour or take on an aged patina over time. We then saw the exotic skins section, where I was admonished for touching these insanely expensive pieces that would then be made up into bags. Asnires is the only place where Louis Vuitton's exotic skin bags are made so I rightfully deserved to be reprimanded considering how expensive some of them are. Here are some stingray and python skins. What I didn't know was that the shiny sheen on a croc or alligator skin is actually created by rolling an agate stone over the skin until it takes on a shine. Again, we weren't allowed to take pictures but basically a leather cutting machine controlled by lasers expertly cuts the leather pieces to make up the bags and thus reduces wastage because of its accuracy. Going back to that banned \"Handmade\" advert, it seems to me that whilst machines are used at Louis Vuitton, without the judgement and expertise of a human being, there's no way of producing the bags. Working the laser-cutting machine and a leather sewing machine is an admirable skill in itself. I didn't see any fully automated processes and in the latter stages especially with the saddle stitched handles and the hammering of the nails into the luggage, you end up with products that have been touched by many more human hands than mechanic probes. Each piece of luggage comes with a working lock and if you're lucky enough to own several pieces of luggage, you can co-ordinate the locks so that one key opens up all of them. The hand-eye coordination work got especially intense when it came to the hammering and trimming the trunks. The little nails are hammered in by hand and judged by eye to get the spacing right. Upstairs was where a lot of the trunks were getting finished, prepped and ready to be shipped off. Some people were also creating the special orders that comes through the atelier. This article here is a feature on Patrick Vuitton and talksa bout some of the weird requests that Vuitton has received ranging from an iPod and speaker case for Karl Lagerfeld, to a little leather case for someone to hold their rubber duck. The designs, whilst far fetched do have some limitations though. I refuse to design furniture, Patrick explains. We are in the business of movement. Nothing is made by our master craftsmen that cannot be easily transported. This trunk here is therefore the maximum size Louis Vuitton can make and if it ain't got a handle on it, they're definitely not making it. On a mezzanine floor where the noise level plummets to a near silence is the exotic skins atelier. It's quiet because the level of concentration here is soaringly high. The expense of these skins weighs heavily on the shoulders of the workers and thus the responsibility to turn out a superbly finished, finely tuned product is definitely evident. A small production line of Sofia Coppola for Louis Vuitton's bag in black alligator. Yup, still looking incredibly covetable despite their unfinished state. Helmut Newton's image of a Crocodile Eating Ballerina from Pina Bausch's ballet in 1983 concludes these educational steps into learning about the atelier process at Louis Vuitton. If anything, I already knew vaguely what steps were involved in the making of Vuitton products, but the pride of the workers was something that was more unexpected. We weren't allowed to photograph their faces but they were happy to show off what they were working on, no matter how minute each step was. I only wish I could have spent more time there before they all started clocking off. .. I thought a visit to the Champs Elysee mahussive flagship store in Paris wouldn't be anything new but seeing as my last visit was back in 2006 when I came out all indignant and huffy, this time round, I got a refresher class on the store. For a start, I missed the 20 metre high atrium where steel rods cascade down along with a flood of natural light. I think this was built in 2007 when the store was expanded and redone by the architects Peter Marino and Eric Carlson. I didn't see these floating trunks along the wall on the ground floor I didn't know Louis Vuitton published paperbacks of some choice classics I didn't think that they'd still be reproducing the pack-away bed-in-the-trunk for the modern customer. The store manager said \"It can be for someone who wants a bed in their garden!\" It's definitely an intangible cloud cuckoo land when people have foldaway beds in their gardens that probably cost more than their actual bed but still, if you can afford it, why not? I also didn't see that the doorway is flanked by two red columns of red LV luggage as a tribute to their Chinese customers. Yes, Chinese customers still flood into the store and buy at a rampant pace. I don't think they're into buying up anything and everything that is monogrammed anymore. I'm told that the Damier in fact has overtaken the monogram in the last few years as the more popular choice. I missed this cruise collection print which does cheesily feature a lot of postcard moments but I quite like the white tippex feel of the print. In ready to wear, I also spied a pair of python culottes. Why stop at leather culottes (i.e. my ASOS ones) when I can have ones in light python as well? // The more discreet bag options are available at the store's made to order lounges where you can choose your leathers and linings for a bag that doesn't scream \"LV\". We also got a little lesson in how to pack our luggage. Well, how to pack Louis Vuitton luggage specifically. I didn't learn anything especially new other than our packing guide, reminded me that I should stuff my shoes with socks and belts so that they keep their shape in the cases and also, if you're folding shirts, turn up the collars and stuff the arms with rolls of tissue paper, so they don't get creased. The final part of our \"Secret Places\" tour ended at the Espace Culturel on the top floor of the store. This part really was a secret as we weren't allowed to take pictures but it's also an art gallery that is entirely open to the walk-in public so in this sense, so this is effectively a place that everyone can enjoy. Just taking the lift designed by Olafur Eliasson is 40 seconds well spent. You enter the lift and once the doors close, it's entirely blacked out so that you can't see a thing and your earing becomes muffled because of the padded walls. It's a deathly quiet 40 seconds either filled with tranquility or clastrophobia depending on the person. I rather enjoyed it. If I'm honest, I wasn't expecting such a well-curated exhibition at the Espace Culturel. Fashion brands supporting and collaborating with the field of art isn't anything new and there's a sense of tokenism about brands that \"dabble\" in the art field. However, Louis Vuitton hasn't been dabbling. The Espace Culturel goes out of its way to support up and coming artists to create emphatic exhibitions that, whilst they are all themed around Louis Vuitton's moniker of travel, the resulting works are expansive in scope and execution. The current exhibition Anichroes explores the musical instrument and its impact first as an object and vehicle of sound all by itself, then as a discourse of interaction with the player. It's all intriguing and interactive and again I could have spent longer. As an art space in its own right, it's definitely worth escaping the doldrum of Champ Elysee and losing yourself for a moment on the way up.",

Though it's like that it's the ideas, a particular motifs or a technique that lingers longer in memory. LCF's MA exhibition at Bloomsbury House,showcasing the final projects of the fashion artefact, digital fashion, fashion curation and footwear to name but a few, just gets bigger and better, year on year. So much so, that I've had to split out my posts on both the exhibition at the MA show which was held once again at the V&A's Raphael Hall last Thursday. I'll kick off with fashion artefact and footwear design, the part of the exhibition that was particularly impressive not only because the designs left an impression but also that they had real sustainable legs. You forgot that these were MA graduate projects but looked at them as though they were viable products, ready to go to market and that was the case for a lot of the students anyway which makes it doubly exciting to watch out for. .. Ruth Holland (MA Fashion Artefact) The upcycling concept of putting rubbish to good use isn't anything new but you would never guess that Ruth Holland's pastel hued neck confectionary was made out of industrial waste materials. String and plastic cording find their way into multi-coloured configurations that are twisted together with traditional rope-making techniques. It's the delicious application of colour that really transforms this waste into something special. .. Linda Holten Ramsvik(MA Fashion Artefact) LCF has seen some real travel bag gems come through in the last few years such as Sarah Williams and her unexpectedly cuved handmade luggage. Linda Holten Ramsvik looks to add herself to that category with her final project that was inspired by travelling and the multi-purpose needs for the modern day bag carrier. Proving her point, I myself was carrying a heavy DSLR, a leather tote bag and a smaller handbag. Her creations here negates that need with her two or even three in one bags. Safari waistcoats come with a hood and huge pockets. A sunglasses carrier holds four glasses. A granny grocery trolley gets a neat transformation into something sleek (I secretly wish I could get away with a granny trolley, what with my weak wrists). Texture in the form of deconstructed Norwegian embroidery prevents the line-up from looking too flat. .. Hoon Chung(MA Fashion Footwear) 3D printing is slowly cropping up in fashion in a way that means anytime soon, I'm going to have to go and see it for myself because I still can't quite believe that a 3D object with facets, curves and highly specific shapes can be printed out. The very word print throws me off entirely. Hoon Chung's 3D printed shoes opens up the eyes to the possibility of a pair of shoes coming out of a \"printer\". They're very much in line with the sort of thoughtful innovation that the likes of Helen Furber worked on when she was at LCF, rethinking the traditional shoe makine process and pushing the field forward into an unpredictable place. .. Anne Gammelgaard (MA Fashion Artefact) Not every graduate approached their final project with the goal to put out a commercial collection of products. Anne Gammelgaard based her artefact design on a character a thing-finder rooting through a post-apocalyptic scenario to create instruments that will aid her on her special mission. It's as if Gammelgaard is writing a film and creating the props for it with complete conviction. As per her character's story, all the materials are found which shows the breadth of what upcycling can really do. .. Cat Potter (MA Fashion Footwear) Cat Potter's wooden \"shoes\" landed in my inbox a while back and they got me salivated for the exhibition if her peers were going to be anywhere near as focused as her collection. Working with University College London and their 3-axis milling machines, normally used in architecture to create much larger scale building components, Cat wanted to bypass the conventional shoe components and create an object out of wood that would gradually build up from a rectangular block to a more shoe-like sandal shape. Functionality wasn't the goal here as Cat wanted to explore an entirely alternative mode of construction. Blending in furniture and architecture into footwear isn't entirely new but it's interesting that these \"shoes\" take the methodology behind those aforementioned fields and applies them to footwear. It's an extreme that can really only be appreciated when you see Cat's future work which hopefully we will see more of. .. Christina Hamilton (MA Fashion Artefact) If I had passed Christina Hamilton's work a year ago, I might not have been as interested in her saddlery led bike accessories. The Tweed Run experience of last year and the fact that Steve has just got himself a handsome new bike makes Christina's work suddenly all the more relevant. Not that she needs fairweather cyclists like myself. Whether it's down to Boris bikes or not, London is a cyclist-heavy city and handsome accessories that don't sacrifice aesthetic for functionality will only become higher in demand. Christina hopes to develop a business out of her leather bike wares that are made using traditional saddlery techniques and on the bikes at the exhibition, her pieces already looked like they were ready to hit the road. .. Chi Yuen (MA Fashion Footwear) I actually met Chi (also called Cherry) back in 2008 in San Francisco as part of the Arts of Fashion competition. She was doing womenswear back then but has refocused on footwear and has since gained work experience at the likes of Celine and Alexander Wang. Her graduate collection is really geared towards launching a solo brand. The warped and draped leather as well as the ruching of fur are unexpected details in this highly polished collection. These extremities are tempered enough to the point where you can already see them walking down the street, a recurring theme with a lot of the MA Fashion Artefacts/Footwear graduates. .. Jen Wang (MA Fashion Artefact) I was trying to rack my brains to see whether previous LCF fashion artefacts students had done sunglasses and in fact Jen Wang is the first one to do it. It was also the first time I'd ever tried on anything at a graduate exhibition which made the reality of Jen Wang bringing these glasses to production, all the more appealing. Based on bipolar personalities and the sunglasses as a face-changer, these highly complex designs really put Wang's sunglasses in a different league from the bulk of standardised frames that exist. Designers sunglasses so often rely on the strength of a brand or a logo and Jen Wang really opens up the opportunties of pushing sunnies to becoming the central focus rather than the tack-on accessory. Incidentally, it was also in China that Jen made these exquisite sunglasses, which sheds light on how the Made in China label will inevitably change in the future. Another Wang to add into the fashion fold would be no bad thing if we were able to get our mitts on sunglasses of this ilk.",

        "extracted_text": "2012-02-13 Made Abroad There were two awesome parties going on Saturday night. One was down in my hotel lobby at the Tribeca Grand. The other was in my head, a continual buzz of high after seeing a trio that had transplanted themselves to Milk Made. For those not familiar with New York Fashion Week's schedule structure. Basically you have all the razzy dazzy shows up at the Lincoln Centre, a scattering of them dotted around galleries in Chelsea, a few off site shows in wildly downtown/uptown locations and then a concentration of cool happening at Milk Studios, what was formerly known as Mac Milk is now rebranded as Milk Made schedule. It's also the place where I happen to spend most of my NYFW week because season after season, they welcome up and coming designers into their fold and provide them with the infrastructure to put on a show or a presentation. You end up with a mix of semi-established, up and coming as well as static accessories designers showing their wares. It's a lot of bang for your buck basically. On Saturday, Milk Made welcomed two new designers into their circle, both from out of town, not that it matters a jot. This is New York of course, city of opportunity and new beginnings. Calla from Paris (originally from Canada), Ostwald Helgason from London (originally from Iceland and Germany) join Dean Quinn, ex-resident of London (originally from Ireland) to form a trio of out-of-towners that together made my night. Search all of them on the sidebar to the right, and ye will find multiple posts on all of them dating back to the early days of Style Bubble when images were a lot smaller and words peppered with one too many exclamation mark. Still, I feel like reverting to bad habits!!!!!!!! I was well and truly excited to see all of them evolve and excite the crowd in New York. The openness of the presentations basically means anybody who's vaguely interested can walk in and check it out, so there was a lot of raw enthusiasm with people bouncing from one room to the other on the eight floor. .. First up was Calla, whose feminine and abstracted digital prints I've always had a soft spot for. She hasn't strayed too far from that territory and if anything the Leith Clark's styling accentuated the girlish charm of Calla Haynes's print work which this season distorted wood grains and granite flecks so that they almost looked like florals from afar or torrid ink blots on wet paper. The wood grain background in the set, which also looked like a silk moire (a fabric which she has successfully used in the past) really boosted the static presentation and made you want to step right into this candy pink corner, mixing and matching Calla's prints. They work in tandem with one another or as solid monochramtic print too and with simple dresses, trousers and covetable items like a shearling biker jacket, adding to Calla's signature built-in bustier dress, this was a more than competent \"Hello\" to the New York crowd. .. Arguably, Dean Quinn's presentation caused the most fuss with the least number of silhouettes. Thirteen dresses that have reduced his eye from detailing from the overt to the subtle (see my early posts of Dean Quinn's graduate work and you shall find a giant leap from then and now). Zippers were the central motif here and gave the silk crepe dresses an energy, to take away any notions of mere red carpet material (although, I'm sure Quinn's work will find their way on to some starlet or another soon). Apparently, his S/S 12 collection has been flying off the racks in Barneys. This might have something to do with his smart pricing with nothing bieng over $1,000. That's pretty much a reasonable price when it comes to high-end designer dress leagues. I'm only slightly disappointed that his breakout didn't occur in London but still, New York have welcome him with open arms and it's working for him so I can only see an onward and upward rise from here on end. .. Ostwald Helgason are new to the Milk Made schedule and made a banging start with what I think is their best presentation yet. Their collections that are shown at the London Fashion Week exhibition have been quietly gaining momentum, picking up stockists like Opening Ceremony. I've already logged in a huge personal order for S/S 12 just because they seem to pick up on the oddest textural detailing and motifs. Last season it was cork and laminated dried hydrangeas. This season, it's nautical stripes and sea monsters. Looking at old antique maps and Nordic seafaring tales, Susanne Helgason and Invgar Ostwald honed in on the nautical stripe and spliced them into neat little shifts and flared hem skirts, adding unexpected colours that you might not associate with the oft-used nautical theme. The sea monsters appeared as an illustration on sweatshirts and some seriously covetable knitwear bulked out this precise collection. The waffle knits did have a Jonathan Saunders feel to them except the duo used effective colour combinations that really make them the sort of winter warmers that you'd wear over and over again.",

        "extracted_text": "2015-05-22 The Next Savage Beauties When I put out an opinion poll out onInstagram asking which young designercould,aesthetics aside, leave a lasting legacy like Lee McQueen, the names that came up pleasingly revolved around London:Simone Rocha,Christopher Kane andJ.W. Anderson. They are all brands with sure fire longevity in the making (or in Kanes case, this already exists). There were also some curveball answers like Jeremy Scott or Alexander Wang, who are perhaps diametricallyoppositetoMcQueen. Perhaps people got stuck on the word legacy and thought of the brands that would go the distance. To conclude my collaboration with American Express, which first began with a visit to the McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition at the V&A, I wanted to put togethera list oftrailblazingdesignersthat I think draw comparison with McQueenon an aesthetic level, but that also place innovation and experimentation at the heart of what they do,and who might also merit having theirworkscrutinised bya museum curator twenty years from now, just as McQueen has. Nowadays, the word groundbreaking isnt often seen in fashion showreviews, unless used as hyperbole. And yet I believe that McQueen, for all his love of the historical and the traditional, did break new ground, whether it was in the cut of a silhouette or in his mode of showmanship. Therefore perhaps the question should be different:Who is currently innovating fashion and pushing it to somewhere that can be called new? The one name that did get crop upon Instagram unsurprisingly, was Dutch designerIris van Herpen.If not for the stylistic and thematic similarities, then for her demi-couture approach that only recently saw her branch off from haute couture to ready to wear. In my opinion, you can see her work is no less considered, as incredible close-up shots of the fabrics from her latest Hacking Infinity A/W 15-6 collection reveal. Her work simply does not come from the realm of convention,nor is it bound by a sense of reality. For her latest collection, van Herpen imagined the biosphere of another planet and the textures that might inhabit its terrain. A stainless steel weave is burnt so that it glimmers with hues of an oil-slick and then pleated and shaped into circular formations.A 3D hand woven grid-like textile is created in collaboration with Aleksandra Gaca,creatingan optical illusion. In an ongoing bid to constantly look beyond fashion, van Herpen also works with professor ofarchitecturePhilip Beesley, to design sculptural dresses made out of fractal-like geometries. Crystals crafted from 3D printing grow from beneath the vertiginous heels of Noritaka Tatehana. McQueen had already begun to probe the dystopian questions ofhow the world might look in the future.Van Herpen has set herself the path to take that probing further, aided by technologies in fabricationsthat McQueen mayhave delved into himself. It might be fair to say Kunihiko Morinaga of Anrealagehas drawnmore comparisons with Hussein Chalayan than Alexander McQueen. His shows,which have decamped from Tokyo Fashion Week to Paris for the last two seasons,deserve praise for their willingness to open our jaded eyes to something really new.Last season for Morinagas Paris debut, he played with photo and heat sensitive inks on white garments so that faint patterns would be revealed when shone with laser-like beams of light. This season, the effect was more dramatic as it was inverted with seemingly black fabrics made to reveal hidden patterns under ultraviolet light.That effect was pre-empted with blacked-out garments printed with fade-in/fade-out patterns. In the final portion of the show, outtrooped models in black ensembleswhich were embedded with photochromic patterns, that could only be seen when under UV light.The UV spotlights moving around revealed distinct patterns of polka dots, floral prints and checks that would then disappear into darkness as soon as the UV was switched off.Its difficult to assess where all this supreme fabric research and innovation can go in the practical world,but I believe Morinaga is shining a spotlight (literally) on what may be possiblein the world of textiles and theres still so much potential. Anrealagesshows are a feast for the brain.You leave excited about what is next. A video posted by @susiebubblevid on May 21, 2015 at 6:08am PDT A video posted by Susie Lau (@susiebubble) on Mar 3, 2015 at 8:55am PST Finally,The Unseenisnt a fashion label per se,but to me, it embodies the trailblazing spirit of McQueen in what it does.Founded by self-proclaimed alchemist Lauren Bowker, who studied printed textiles at the Royal College of Art, The Unseen is more like a house of exploration, focusingonthe metamorphosis of materials.Bowker has been creating chromic, colour-chana inks that can then be applied to various disciplines, with fashion being one of them.Alongside Bowker, The Unseen, now based in the Vaults in Somerset House, consists of anatomists, engineers, chemists and pattern cutters, who collectively aim to put their magick into bespoke projects. Their work is primarily based around inks that are sensitive to wind, heat, moisture and light and they, in turn, have been applied tocouture piecesthat act as a spectacular showcasein terms of what The Unseen can do. For example,a winged cape that changes colour upon contact with the air around it, or a skull cap glowing with Swarovski spinel stones that visualise the heat loss from the head,graduating in colour from orange to red to green, to blue to purple. Its latest piece entitled, Eight Sense is a coded couture piece, which changes in response to real-time digital media as it aims to discover and investigate the human state of being, by using a physical garment linked with human magnetism. So, basically a wearable mood ring? You might ask, who really needs that? But when the effects are so beautiful, it makes you wonder how much more we can explore by bringing chemistry and fashion together. Youre more than welcome to find out more by visitingThe Unseen as they continue their explorative residency at Somerset House. Ill be delving deeper intowhat theirmagick entails soon enoughand keeping an eye on all the aforementioned talent to see how they continue to trail blaze in their work; just as Alexander McQueen did before them.",

        "extracted_text": "2015-05-15 Versus Calling Ah London. How Ive missed trampling up damp smelling staircases to get to concrete bunker roomswhere I get sploshed about with beer. Its back down to earth after my far-and-away otherworldly jaunts to Palm Springs and Cannes but with Donatella Versace leading the proceedings, it was never really going to be yer average event. Last night saw the first Versuscollection presented by Anthony Vaccarello, after his appointment as permanent creative director of the line, at a #VersusCalling event in London. When Versus was entrusted toDonatella by brother Gianni in the nineties, she was keen to kick things up a notch with by injectinga young and clubby spirit with party-slash-gig-slash-presentations. The recent reboot phase of Versus has followed in more or less the same line. The event last night was termed ahappening and with an emphasis now on the e-commerce, this collection is the first to adhere to Donatellas See Now-Buy Now-Wear Now concept as most of the pieces are available to buy straight away. And so we went up those familiardank stairs of the Old Truman Brewery festooned with #VersaceCalling tape to catch the skyline of London disappearing into darkness. Under shelter from the appropriately drizzlyskies, the latest campaign images shot by Collier Schorr and styled by Alastair McKimm were projected onto the walls, with the intermittent playing of a choppy short film by Natalie Canguilhem. Donatella and Anthony held court over performances by upcoming bands Nothing But Thieves and Zibra (picked out by Donatellas son apparently) with the likes of Maisie Williams and Jaimie Winstone in the crowd to mosh away with the pair. Well actually, knowing Anthony, he was more of a stoic observer whilst on the other hand, Donatella waved hands like she just didnt care. In my beer-friendly plaid shirt and kilt and flat Versus bovver boots complete with safety pin hardware, Iwas also happy to be back in my natural habitat. Nothing But Thieves Zibra performing on stage Roman Kemp DJ-ing Maisie Williams line of the night was Oh my god shes not a child! She has boobs! Wearing Versus plaid shirt and asymmetric kiltfrom the new collection Hardwareready to pound concrete with new season Versus boots and Versus safety pin bracelet and leather cuff With my bro Adam Chinese Symbol Whilst the primary reference of this latestcollection was the lithe Brett Anderson in his Suede heyday, Vaccarellos treatment of his own Versus references primarily the campaign imagery shot by Bruce Weber in the nineties have continued to yield piecesthat resurrect that yesteryear Versus spirit. For this see-it-buy-it-wear-it collection, Stella Tennant flanked by rugged redhead ladsin Scottish tartan from a 1995 campaign made its presence be known with asymmetric kilts (for guys and girls), plaid sweaters and perfectly proportioned shirts that can be semi-tucked in and out. The black dresses of Vaccarellosfirst outing for Versus also reappear with askant hemlines and Versace lions head continues to rear its head in the silver hardware. The happeningmay have been in London but the appeal of Vaccarellos Versus revival certainly goes far and beyond the big smoke.",

Im interested in exploring our connections to ourselves & each other, the idea of finding novelty & adventure in everyday life, our rituals, symbols, nature, dreams, travel, our quest for self-development, and how we piece it all together to create personal meaning & a sense of belonging to the greater whole. she also makes the cutest cards ever. this one made me laugh and this one brought a little tear to my eye. you can buy everything by Laura Berger here.",

Okay by this time I was getting sick of everything I had packed. Really, really sick, or more specifically, impulse purchase vulnerable sick. So after dragging a tireless man friend around Robertson Blvd. (the day of the Chanel opening!) and becoming thoroughly depressed by the Givenchy and Chloe shoes and Chanel sunglasses I couldnt afford, I went into LF for some friendlier prices and bought these Jeffrey Campbell mummy-esque (in the wrapped zombie way) Proenza knockoffs. Do note that they are weirdly much cheaper at Nordstrom, Ive been had! Oh well. I like the army green enough to almost not be bitter. We found this pretty park in Culver City after excitedly parking nearby to go to the Museum of Jurassic Technology, only to find that it didnt open till 2. I suppose it was foolish to expect such an establishment to operate on a normal schedule, and we decided it was most likely run by vampires. We killed time in the park until it opened, daintily sipping watermelon juice and raspberry lemonade. But the wait was well worth it. Let me tell you, it was the oddest, most WTF-inducing experience Ive had in a while..everything from taxidermied rabbits to real mice corpses on toast (seriously) to an entire room dedicated to the fine art of cats cradle and microscopic artwork done in the eyes of needles, all in an eery almost pitch black environment. LA people need to grab their weirdest friends and check this out (and make sure to linger in the Soviet space dog gallery and tea room upstairs!). I told my friend that he should plan on taking all future first dates there to test their taxidermy stamina. He calmly responded that he had already planned on doing so. Note that this is what my hair looks like when I havent touched a hairbrush for three days, I of course managed to forget this extremely necessary device before driving up. Then I foolishly sprayed this weird salt spray in it, which only served to tangle even further. It took some serious muscles to brush it out when I got home, which was kind of a shame, since Im pretty sure I was forming my first authentic dreadlocks. A huge thank you to R the Friar for his immaculate hosting skills and teaching me the glory of Guitar Hero. I guess I need an X Box now.
