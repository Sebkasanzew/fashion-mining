{"extracted_text":"\nAfter my house is clean, my laundry done and my meals planned for the next week, I finally have the head space to think about how I want to improve myself for the next year. I like the idea of resolutions. Sure - we may not keep all of them, or any of them, but it\u2019s still nice to have some conscious goals to work towards in the name of self improvement. LISTENINGI\u2019m trying a lot harder to do less talking about myself (when I\u2019m nervous, it\u2019s easy to do) and instead hear more of what others are saying. Asking open ended questions \u201Chow did you do that?\u201D or \u201Ctell me more about that\u201D are helping me in this arena.

Croft Bag: Inexpensive doesn\u2019t mean you have no choice but to go for a youthful vibe. Solid structure and ladylike design speak of nothing but polish. I can see this dangling from Taylor Swift\u2019s delicate arm. At Need Supply Co. for $68.\n2. & Other Stories Leather Bowling Bag: I love the tough-meets-sweet color combo of black and pale pink, and this daily bowling bag will never go out of style. At & Other Stories for $59 (from $195).\n3. & Other Stories Small Faux Snake Shoulder Bag: Nothing like a little bit of red snakeskin (So what if it\u2019s faux? We can\u2019t carry real python all the time) to turn the attitude of your outfit up a few notches. At & Other Stories for $53 (from $175).\n4. & Other Stories Faux Shearling and Leather Clutch: H&M offshoot & Other Stories does it again with the perfect rugged winter clutch. They\u2019ve also managed to make a functional wristlet strap look cool, thanks to the symmetrical placement. At & Other Stories for $43 (from $85).\n5. Adidas by Stella McCartney Canvas Gym Bag: We love a gym bag that can double as a casual weekender or a sporty carryon and this roomy canvas tote does that and more. On MATCHESFASHION.com for $53 (from $76).\n6. The Cambridge Satchel \u2018The Tiny\u2019 Crossbody Bag: It may have had a big moment last year, but have no doubt: the Cambridge Satchel\u2019s bags are still a strong frugal staple. On Farfetch for $100.51.\n7. Soeur Sac 3 Tote: Snap up this summery woven north-south tote, priced nicely under a hundred bucks, and make like you picked it up on your last jaunt to St. Bart\u2019s. At Barneys New York for $95.\n8. Nasty Gal Passing the Bucket Bag: Consider this little dark cherry-colored treat your companion when you\u2019re ready to have a rowdy night out \u2013 and you don\u2019t want to destroy one of your more investment-ready favorites. At Nasty Gal for $38.\n9. Zara Mini Embossed City Bag: Zara has done it again: They\u2019ve produced a bag that\u2019s not only eerily reminiscent of much higher end variation but one that looks just as great. At Zara for $40 (from $70).\n10. Rebecca Minkoff Leo Striped Faux Leather Envelope Clutch: Last but not least, no frugal find list would be complete without Rebecca Minkoff. I love this slim envelope clutch for its sleek design and amped-up stripes. At Saks Fifth Avenue for $95."},"url":"http:\/\/www.snobessentials.com\/2016\/01\/10-bags-under-100.html","pipe":{"text":"For those of you who didn\u2019t think such a list is possible, think again.

{"extracted_text":"\nI\u2019ve been promising to do an updated beauty routine post for a while\u2026here it is! It\u2019s always so hard to condense a beauty post. I\u2019m a beauty junkie, so I\u2019m sorry in advance if this runs long! Not all of the products I\u2019m going to mention are pictured (some of my more well-loved makeup is too far gone to photograph) but I will include links to all. I\u2019ll do a night time routine soon as well!\nSKINCARE:\nEvery morning I wash my face using a gritty washcloth with Fresh Soy Cleanser. Then I apply Dear By Tone Up Booskin toner with a cotton pad, and follow up by massaging a few drops of Hylamide Glow Serum into my face. This serum builds up a very subtle natural glow in your skin. I get pasty in the winter,  so I love how this brings the life back to my complexion. If I have time in the morning, I like to do a Korean sheet mask before I get ready. Before I begin my makeup, I completely saturate my skinwith moisture by using a lot of face cream. Right now I love Dr. Jart\u2019s Cermadin cream. It makes a great base for makeup and protects my skin when we are out shooting on freezing cold mornings! For SPF, I\u2019ve been using MISSHA\u2019s waterproof sun milk for years now. It is very light and non-greasy. If I am having a breakout, I apply this acne serum to help clear it up faster.\nPRIMER:\nI always start my makeup with Bare Minerals Skin Revver-Upper. It has glycolic and salicylic acid in it that plump up your skin instantly. I must warn you, it smells a little weird! If I have a long day of shooting ahead, I will also use Hourglass\u2019s Mineral Veil Primer. This makes your makeup waterproof, so it has major lasting power, even through rain or working out.\nFOUNDATION:\nI use a few foundations on a rotating basis, but here are my favorites. My current favorite is CoverFx\u2019s Custom Cover Drops. This is a concentrated foundation serum that is meant to be mixed with skin care. As a skin care freak, this is a dream come true! I mix mine with a drop of a honey skin oil and apply it with a stippling brush. Mixed with oil, this gives the dewiest skin ever. Huge fan of this!\nI also use Bare Minerals broad spectrum foundation in Fair very regularly. I\u2019ve been using Bare Minerals since I was 13, I\u2019m still in love with it!

This is one of those colors that would suit anyone! I never apply from the tube, I tap it on as a sheer stain with my fingers.

It\u2019s always so hard to condense a beauty post. I\u2019m a beauty junkie, so I\u2019m sorry in advance if this runs long! Not all of the products I\u2019m going to mention are pictured (some of my more well-loved makeup is too far gone to photograph) but I will include links to all. I\u2019ll do a night time routine soon as well!\nSKINCARE:\nEvery morning I wash my face using a gritty washcloth with Fresh Soy Cleanser. Then I apply Dear By Tone Up Booskin toner with a cotton pad, and follow up by massaging a few drops of Hylamide Glow Serum into my face. This serum builds up a very subtle natural glow in your skin. I get pasty in the winter,  so I love how this brings the life back to my complexion. If I have time in the morning, I like to do a Korean sheet mask before I get ready. Before I begin my makeup, I completely saturate my skinwith moisture by using a lot of face cream. Right now I love Dr. Jart\u2019s Cermadin cream. It makes a great base for makeup and protects my skin when we are out shooting on freezing cold mornings! For SPF, I\u2019ve been using MISSHA\u2019s waterproof sun milk for years now. It is very light and non-greasy. If I am having a breakout, I apply this acne serum to help clear it up faster.\nPRIMER:\nI always start my makeup with Bare Minerals Skin Revver-Upper. It has glycolic and salicylic acid in it that plump up your skin instantly. I must warn you, it smells a little weird! If I have a long day of shooting ahead, I will also use Hourglass\u2019s Mineral Veil Primer. This makes your makeup waterproof, so it has major lasting power, even through rain or working out.\nFOUNDATION:\nI use a few foundations on a rotating basis, but here are my favorites. My current favorite is CoverFx\u2019s Custom Cover Drops. This is a concentrated foundation serum that is meant to be mixed with skin care. As a skin care freak, this is a dream come true! I mix mine with a drop of a honey skin oil and apply it with a stippling brush. Mixed with oil, this gives the dewiest skin ever. Huge fan of this!\nI also use Bare Minerals broad spectrum foundation in Fair very regularly. I\u2019ve been using Bare Minerals since I was 13, I\u2019m still in love with it! It photographs beautifully up close and its never cakey. If I have any sort of breakout going on, this is the foundation I\u2019m using.\nCONCEALER, BRONZER, AND LUMINZER:\nI\u2019ve recently discovered Benefit\u2019s Erase Paste\u2026best under eye concealer ever!

This time of year is all about bringing loved ones together, so why not turn even present-wrapping into a party?!\nGrowing up, our mother attended an annual gift-wrapping event with her friends. It was an all day affair: come when you can, bring gifts to wrap, and enjoy a few hours of laughter, music, and great conversation. Inspired by this memory, we threw our very own Wrap Party last week \u2013 complete with a plethora of craft supplies and plenty of Ecco Domani wine. In collaboration with our girlfriends, we\u2019ve compiled our 10 favorite DIY gift-wrapping ideas from the day. We hope they will inspire you to throw together your own wrappin\u2019 and happenin\u2019 this year!\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED: a serious assortment of wine, plus wrapping paper, ribbons, and greenery to play with. Have each of your guests bring one item to contribute to the crafting \u2013 the conflux of unexpected materials will definitely yield new heights of creativity!\n1. Skip the bow and infuse a natural element by tying in a few flowers or leaves. Pick up a bouquet from your local florist to play with, or simply clip them from your own garden.\n2. Save any branches that have fallen from your tree and spray paint them gold for a beautiful and surprisingly simple topper.\n3. Upgrade white craft paper with watercolors. You can make a clean, graphic pattern, or just swirl it all together for an abstract moment.\n4. If you aren\u2019t quite as artistically inclined, just take those watercolors and splatter paint your gift. This one was FUN!\n5. Keep the paint game going with cute polka dot patterns. Use a small paint brush or even the end of a pencil eraser to maintain consistent sizing.\n6. Recycle your old newspapers for a nostalgic twist. It\u2019s also a cute surprise to fill your box with newsprint snowflakes in lieu of tissue paper.\n7. Glue glitter or confetti to upgrade a simple gift box, or use it to trim your tags.\n8. For a playful alternative to your basic bow, accordion-fold some of your leftover paper clippings for a bowtie-like effect, or spiral your gift in pom-pom-lined twine.\n9. You can never go wrong with a classic, oversized silk bow.\n10. For those who haven\u2019t finished their holiday shopping yet, always provide an alternative activity. Gingerbread decorating is oh-so fun and something everyone can bring home to surprise the ones they love. Now pour yourself a glass of wine and have a very happy holiday season!\nPHOTOS| by Lindsay Brown"},"url":"http:\/\/www.theglamourai.com\/2015\/12\/wrap-party.html","pipe":{"text":"10 DIY holiday gift-wrapping ideas your loved ones will treasure.The post Wrap Party appeared first on The Glamourai.\n","title":"Wrap Party"}}

{"extracted_text":"Maxie's posts is spot on today. One of the hardest things that I had to figure out when I quit the rowing team in college was what my morning routine would be. For years I had been waking up extra early to rush to get to school (that 7:25am start always felt terrible) or rushing out the door before the crack of dawn to get to practice. Once I quit though, I had luxurious mornings to fill up. Even my earliest class at 8:50am felt incredibly late. The first few weeks I slept in, but I'd find myself groggy. Then I started to work in a morning routine and it changed how my entire day went. With my first job in NYC, I had a strict morning routine that really set how my whole day would go. I needed that rhythm to get me going! Even working from home, I stick to a routine. I swear by it!How to Create a Morning Routine You Stick to in 2016Guest post by Maxie McCoyThe way you start your day sets the entire tone of the day. Think about all the days you\u2019ve snoozed seventy times only to rush around like a mad person. Or the countless mornings you\u2019ve laid scrolling in bed, waist deep in facebook and Instagram and emails and snaps and texts. Thirty minutes later you\u2019re almost late for class or work and didn\u2019t have time to fuel your body. I know. Been there. So guilty. That used to be so me. And then a few years ago I got the wild idea to stop pushing emails right to my phone so that I didn\u2019t have to see everything waiting for me from the time I turned my alarm off. Or in the middle of the night when I woke up for some reason.  It was an amazing change because I finally was able to erase my morning anxiety. My chest didn\u2019t tighten within 5 minutes of waking up. This year, I\u2019ve upped my morning game by creating an entire morning routine that doesn\u2019t include my phone. No emails. No social. No texts. No calls. Pings. Mentions. Comments. Surfing. Double taps. Or scrolling. It\u2019s almost a full hour digital detox each morning like this one so that I can make breakfast, meditate and get ready before diving into the digital world. It\u2019s slow, peaceful, and all mine.And it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s tremendously hard to turn my alarm off while seeing some of the notifications on my homescreen and not want to check everything and just get right into it. I\u2019m tempted to scroll through facebook and twitter while I\u2019m drinking my tea. And I occasionally wonder if there\u2019s anything significant going on that needs my attention. There\u2019s not. There never has been.

The best way to combat the temptation of your phone (and it is actually an addiction) is to not have to fight it.

{"extracted_text":"April 29, 2015\nReview: Palihouse, West Hollywood\nOf all the places I travel for work or for pleasure, I'm in Los Angeles the most. It's funny, when you visit a place fairly regularly - you get into a routine. You stay at the same hotels, eat at the same places. Often, I can spend my entire 2-3 days in a square mile radius!\nThis trip, I knew I wanted a different experience. I'd venture out and stay at a hotel I've never been to and go for more of that home away from home feeling.

Den karierten Schal von Zara kennt ihr vielleicht schon aus dem letzten Outfit , der schwarz-weiße Schal (nicht aktuell), die Handschuhe (aus dem letzten Jahr) und die Mütze (aktuell) sind von H&M.\nVor kurzem hab ich die Marke Kringle Candle Company für mich entdeckt. Schon im April bin ich durch Wien-Mitte darauf aufmerksam geworden, hab dann wieder darauf vergessen, bis die liebe Julia vor kurzem ein Bild dazu auf Instagram gepostet hat. Sie sind den Kerzen von Yankee Candle sehr ähnlich, kein Wunder denn die Idee dazu kam vom Sohn des Erfinders der Yankee Candle Company. Das schlichte Design der Kringle Kerzen gefällt mir aber um einiges besser. Ich hab im Österreichischen Online Shop gleich eine große Bestellung aufgegeben, aber davon sind einige Kerzen schon als Weihnachtsgeschenke gedacht.\nHerbst und Tee gehören für mich zusammen. Ich versuche jeden Tag mindestens zwei Liter davon zu trinken. Damit es nicht langweilig wird, hab ich einen riesen Vorrat zu Hause angesammelt. Meine liebsten Sorten sind momentan Ingwer & Zitrone von Teekanne und Kusmi Tea und die Sachermischung von Haas & Haas.

I prefer to use pencils in my planner, so I don't have to cross something out. (I would much rather erase!) I believe in function over fad, meaning I don't always rush out for the latest and greatest supplies. I stick to what works for me--even if that is simply printer paper on a clipboard. \nStory behind my desk: I purchased this desk from Target four weeks after I graduated from Georgetown in 2007. It was my first \"big girl\" furniture purchase--made completely on my own without help from my folks. Truth be told, it worked beautifully in my shiny and new DC apartment, but it doesn't quite fit the aesthetic of our loft in Providence. Since we'll be building our first home soon, my husband and I have held off buying any new furniture so that we can outfit it to the nines. I have bold plans for what that desk will look like, but for now, this beauty works just fine.  \n( LongDistanceLoving.net )\nKatie Rudder 's Tips for Staying Organized\n1. Invest in a calendar and agenda. Keep them as organized and as up to date as possible!\n2. Quote books can help you remain motivated. It's how I de-stress and remember sayings and quotes I like. I write in it only with specific markers to keep it looking similar and flip through it depending on my mood!\nStory behind my desk: I bought my desk from Walmart actually, which most people would never believe! I moved into my house and was forced to buy a few major pieces of furniture since our house was only partially furnished. Realizing quickly I would not be able to survive a summer, let along a school year, without a desk I started hunting. About a week later a big, bevy box arrived on my doorstep. Putting together a piece of furniture on your own is hard. Not only were the directions unclear, but my desk is different than most--it's a corner desk so everything is shaped funny and oriented differently. I ended up putting it together wrong at times but forged through to finally see the project happily end. With only minor damages when all was said and done, it's proudly finished and well equipped in my room. It's study and blogging HQ and also serves as a place to hold clothes (sorry Mom!). Decked out in pink and green, I don't think I would have it any other way!\nFred Castleberry 's Tips for Staying Organized\n1. Drop the OCD routine and cut yourself some slack\n2. Give everything a \"place\"\n3. Don't procrastinate in putting said object back in that \"place\"\nMy favorite motivational quotation in its entirety:\n\"I think everything in life is art. What you do. How you dress, how you love someone, and how you talk. Your smile and your personality. What you believe in, and all your dreams. The way you drink your tea. How you decorate your home. Or party. Your grocery list. The food you make. How your writing looks. And the way you feel. Life is art.\" \u2014Anonymous\n( UnabashedlyPrep.com )\nI want to see your desks too! You can tweet\/Instagram a picture (tag me so I can see\u2013 @collegeprepster).

Though theyve offered plus sizes for a while now, they acknowledged the need to make things better and have spent the past year researching what plus size women want and perfecting fit issues. If youve had problems with their size chart in the past, know that they have revamped everything and starting now, their plus items should fit much more true to size. Theyre totally open to constant improvement, welcome feedback, and encourage women to share reviews, pictures, and information on how each item fits. Make sure you check out their site if you havent lately! I wore a Dorothy Perkins blazer (on sale here), Forever21 jeans and top, and Aldo heels:   (I did cut my hair, but not that much! Its pinned back.) PS- For those of you that loved the ASOS Maternity swing dress I wore recently, they just added it to the Curve collection, but its already sold out in white!

{"extracted_text":" By Maegan Tintari unbelievable May 7, 2008 A bad case of Orange Face For the past three years Ive been using Bare Minerals make-up and I LOVE IT! Seriously, it takes less than ten minutes to do my make-up in the morning and its mostly fool-proof. However, it seems that when I originally purchased the first kit of colors, I was very tan and chose the medium skin tone. It also seems that over the past three years, tanning has been less appealing to me (maybe because our pool is underground and sucks or maybe because my dad died of skin cancer  could be either?)  anyway, lets just say Im not so tan any more  but somehow I still thought I was. I would try to add make-up to my neck to blend it but it never EVER really blended right. Last week I went to Sephora and decided to try the lighter shade (fairly light instead of just light). I recall trying this color before and it being too pink for meor at least I thought. It is not until now, face and neck the same (or really close to the same) color that I realize that I have been walking around with orange face for at least two years. Im not going to lie, someone mentioned to Pep that I shouldnt wear so much make-up and he informed me of my mistake too. But he just said TOO MUCH MAKE-UP- not THE WRONG COLOR. So it didnt click for me. Im going to TRY to pretend that I actually WAS as tan as I thought I was for a while at least, so as not to crawl up into a whole of embarrassment admitting it was THREE YEARS. Either way, the first step is realizing the problem.

{"extracted_text":" One Tuesday afternoon, I bought a Chanel bag. I had to do it. I have always harbored a poorly concealed crush on the 2.55s boxy frame and softly glazed lambskin. Even when the chain-linked miracle prostituted itself on the arm of Snooki, my love for its classic appeal never wavered. I know that its been deemed suburban and ubiquitous and that all of the Real Housewives carry it, but there is something about its enduring charm that reminds me of my grandmother and pearls and Alexa Chung. So when I spotted it online and on salewhich happens once every neverand discounted by a healthy 30%, I did not hesitate. Now was not the time to ask myself such questions as, Can you put a down payment on a bag? or Do people really sell their kidneys on the black market? I had only one option: Add to Cart. I owned it for exactly thirty minutes. A brief interlude for sanity: Im twenty years old and in college. I may not have the best handle on fiscal responsibility, but Im not financially suicidal. Also, Id prefer that my parents not disown me for retail dalliances that result in the purchase of inky-black leather goods. I could not buy the bag. But I could pretend. For the brief window it would sit in my shopping cart, it would be mine. I wish I could say this is the first time Ive succumbed to such behavior. Years ago, on the last day of a trip to London, I ambled into the Burberry flagship and tried on a trench coat. I slipped each arm through its meticulously pressed sleeves while the store manager bustled about and illustrated her expert tailoring suggestions with a smattering of pins. I was not in the market for this class of investment. But I let the woman in plaid go on, and when she was finished ministering to the garment, I appraised my reflection and asked her if I could put in on hold. Until the end of the day, she said. That would be wonderful, I replied effortlessly. Thank you so much. By the time the store closed that day, I was halfway over the Atlantic. I am in love with the idea of sequestering things I know I cannot have. Its an indulgent practice. Its childish. But fast-forward half a decade and save for a blissful half hour I once spent with my best friend eating raw cookie dough straight from the supermarket package, those 1,800 seconds of fabricated Chanel proprietorship were some of the most exhilarating of my life. They were also the most agonizing. No sooner had I staked my claim in the storied House of Chanel than the cool, mathematical robots behind Shopbop.coms glossy faade saw to its excruciating undoing. But I found my silver lining. Now was my chance, I reasoned. Why stop at Chanel when I could also fictitiously load up on Wang and Stella McCartney? When I could buy white satin loafers? Why settle for a $2,240 price tag when I could let my subtotal wander into quintuple digits with no repercussions? Who would care if I did? You dont pay shipping fees on delusions. As I bid a prolonged adieu to something Id never had, my forever-unrealized future with the original cross-body flashed before my eyes. I imagined slipping it over my shoulder on the cusp of promising Saturday nights only to rescue it later from sticky tables and slimy boys. I envisioned wearing it with sequins and satin and seersucker. Years would go by, and its changing contents would reflectwhat? Maturity? One day I would pass it onits insides defaced with errant pen markings and lipstick stainsto a featureless daughter of mine. Wed had a good run, Id think lovingly, as I bequeathed it to her. Wed been perfect together! But, of course, we hadnt been. We were separating before our first date. We loved each other, but we were irreconcilable. We were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, and although I rooted for us, I knew all along that our differences were insurmountable. Predictably, one of us would rebound (ed note: ricochet) faster than the other. About seven seconds after my thirty-minute grace period had elapsed, I Rip the Band-Aid! refreshed the web page and braced myself. The bag, Shopbop.com informed me, was already sold out. To the woman who swooped in and snatched my shot at happiness: Please be kind. Respect it. Treasure it for more than thirty minutes. Give it the life I never could. Also, friend me on Facebook so that I can stalk you obsessively and inevitably discover that you are French and look sexy in overalls. -Written by Mattie Kahn.

Instead of that I show you another outfit I really like. Its not as black as usual but since its the first sunny day for weeks I think that it fits very well into my current mood. The combination of boyfriend jeans, pumps and the oversized cardigan is just perfect :) ","title":"outfit how to wear a boyfriend jeans"}}

{"extracted_text":" The price were willing to pay for beauty can vary a great deal. You can be wiling to pay an arm and a leg for practical beauty tools or stand firm that drugstore brands get the job done. With so many options it isnt hard to see why people test out the most buzzed about products no matter the price tag. When it comes to buying there are a few rules I follow, but in general if it has solid reviews, contains quality ingredients and applies well, Im in. Ive tried hundreds of productsmany that have blown my mindbut today I wanted to feature 5 of those that no matter what, theyre worth the splurge. JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. 1. Rm DNA Renewal DNA Sheer Defense  Wearing SPF on your face should be a no brainer at this point, but its rare that we think about that protection as a way to help collagen growth as well. DNA Renewal is part of a circle of products emerging that not only act as a light BB Cream with 50+ SPF, but also works to repair existing sun damage with enzymes and vitamins. You could save your money and stick with a 30 SPF face lotion or you can go big to fight cellular damage, even out your skins tone and texture, and be confident that youll have all-day coverage without a high shine, oily finish. 2. La Mer The Lip Balm - La Mer as a brand is no joke. Ive been using their Creme de la Mer for ages, so its not surprising that their a celeb and overall cult fave despite the jaw dropping fee. The Lip Balm is no different. Containing the brands mystery Miracle Broth the balm goes on sheer while moisturizing and restoring your lips texture. Since the skin on our lips is one of the most sensitive, and easily affected by the elements, its important to take great care of them. If youve ever used a balm that had your lips thirsting for another application, you know that you can become dependent on a product. With La Mer that wont happen, but youll want to apply it when necessary for a silky smooth, mega hydrated pout. And if you cant justify using it for only your lips, luckily there are plenty of other uses for lip balm. 3. MAC Cosmetics Penultimate Eye Liner - There are a lot of formulas to use and ways to apply your eyeliner. One that always seems like an easy solution, even for the makeup novice, is a liquid marker-like liner. However most, especially those with more affordable price tags, rarely deliver the color results desired and tend to go on more watery and require more effort than your pencil, cream or typical liquid liner. But when you find the right one, these pen style liners offer precision application and major color payoff. Thats why the MAC Penultimate Liner is a must. Along with the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Liner, these liners dress up your eyes and go on flawlessly. 4. NCLA Nail Lacquers  It can be hard to justify paying $16 for nail polish, especially when we change our polish as quickly as our minds. But between all the brands on the market and color options available, sometimes there seems to be a lack of new, original hues to polish on. Thats where NCLA kills it and is worth every penny. While there are crazy neon colors (which arent true neons btw) from cheaper brands, there just isnt that same confetti meets summer vibe meets Oh You Say You Have Nail Wraps too! like NCLA offers. Their creamy lacquers are made right here in California and are 5-free. And their holographic lineneed I say more! 5. AmorePacific Color Control Cushion Compact  Cushion compacts were one of the most buzzed about beauty products last year and for good reason. Just like MACs eye liner, you have a lot of options when it comes to foundation application, but what makes the AmorePacific Cushion Compact worth the $60 splurge is that its basically 3 beauty products rolled into one. The coverage is unbelievable, the cushion applicator allows you to build your product up for light to heavy coverage days, the cushion also provides a streak-free finish (no brushes required) and it touts SPF 50.

{"extracted_text":" This Sunday marks the end of Daylight Savings Time, which means most of us will be given an extra hour this weekend to do whatever we want! Growing up, this extra hour was never wasted; most of the time, it was spent helping out with family chores or cleaning up and organizing around the house. While I cant force you to do these things on Sunday (Im not your parent, I cant make you), I would encourage you to make the most out of this hour and have an extra productive day! Do something that you would normally put off, or something that isnt really a priority but would be nice to get to at some point. If youre anything like me, bathroom organization is something that definitely falls into this category. My bathroom could always use a little cleaning up  not in the sense that its dirty, but in the sense that it tends to get a little clutteredproducts tend to accumulate, cabinets fill up, and blow dryers get tossed aside in a hurry out the door. And dont even get me started on the mountains of makeup : \/ So, my challenge for you is this: Make the place where you get beautiful more beautiful, and do a little bathroom organization this weekend. It can be hard to know where to start with organization projects, but here are some easy things you can do to clean out your bathroom and maximize your space. 1. Get rid of your old makeup. Here are some guidelines for knowing when its time to toss it. 2. The backs of cabinet doors are organization gold: hang things, store tools, add jars or hooks, adhere a magnetic strip to keep pins in one placethe opportunities are endless! 3. Dont just dump your things on the counter! Well, at least make them look good: head to a craft store or discount home store and pick up some cute jars to toss your things in. Either mix and match, or go for a more classic look with glass or metal jars. You can also use pretty bowls and plates to hold any jewelry you wear on the reg. It will look tidier and more thoughtful! 4. Nail polish storage can actually be very pretty too. Keep your polishes in a giant clear glass jar  no more hiding them in a basket under the sink! 5. Clean. Your. Brushes. You have the time! (Click here for my ultimate brush cleaner.) 6. Organize your go-to makeup. Acrylic trays are great compartmentalizers. You can either buy something like this from IKEA thats specifically for cosmetics, or get inexpensive desk organizers from any organization or super store. This is a great way to store your everyday makeup but also keep it readily accessible. There are so many ways you can clean up and prettify a bathroom, but those are just a few. Getting ready in a neat and tidy area will make you feel so much more zen, especially if you have to share a bathroom! Let me know if you try any of these methods out! And please share your own helpful organization tricks in the comments section belowI just might feature them in a future blog!

You probably just fell in love how I did, so go check out the website and take a look at the new collection  worth every penny! Moving farther up we have my pants from Forever 21 which cost a solid $19 if Im not mistaken and look phenomenal, especially if youre looking for a nice, robust and very slim dress pant. I played with the upper body combination, layering a leather jacket over a cardigan over a turtleneck, hoping to introduce a rocknroll element to the otherwise pretty dapper look.

Most importantly Im beyond thankful to all of you for your support. My blog is so important to me and I work extremely hard on it. Ive never felt proud, or thought that it was anything special.

But for some reason when I saw these pictures, for the first time in my life I felt like what Im doing is important, and people actually care and are listening. Its not about me, its about the blogging world in general and all my fashion blogger friends who are working so hard and accomplishing amazing things that a few years ago no one would have thought was possible. Im not a model or an actress just a normal, small town girl whos passionate about something she loves. Its a dream come true to be able to share that with people around the world and I hope I can inspire others that anything is possible.

{"extracted_text":" December 29, 2014 A Little DIY Wabi Sabi Whereas most of us value things that are perfect and enduring, wabi sabi is the Japanese worldview that sees beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness. Things such as a slightly lopsided vase, a shirt thats missing a button, or an old, wooden desk thats a little too dry. Its believed that by recognizing the beauty in such things, we can better appreciate the natural cycle of life  from growth to decay to eventually death. Jonathan Lukacek  the very talented blogger behind Bandanna Almanac  is certainly familiar with the concept. Hes an American living in Japan, having stayed there after studying abroad for college. Hes also aninveterate thrifter who likes to collect garments with a lot character (rather than things that happen to be rare or hold value). In other words, things that tell a story, as he put it to me. Seen above are some of the creative ways hes repaired his vintage finds. Theres a pair of jeans with pocket bags made from cut-up bandannas; a dirty collar of a denim shirt made new again through some more bandanna cloth; an old Five Brothers flannel with a slightly askew internal pocket (made with just the right amount of pattern matching); a denim jacket with blanket lining on the outside of the coat; and finally, some decorative sashiko stitching on the collar of an old chambray shirt. Everything was done with fabrics that Jonathan has either thrifted or found over the years. Some repairs he did himself; others he did in collaboration with his good friend Narita at Brown Tabby (a vintage repair shop in Japan). All of it is awesome  especially if youve ever appreciated anything at a thrift store or flea market, or even the designer lines that are inspired by such things (e.g. Blue Blue Japan, Kapital, and Visvim).

{"extracted_text":" July 24, 2014 Fragrances, Part Two: How to Choose Something for Yourself In some ways, choosing a fragrance is straightforward: you pick something youd want to wear. At the same time, theres more to it than just sniffing the bottle. The first thing you need to know is that fragrances react to your body and evolve over time. So when youre out shopping for a scent, only use the blotter strips to see what youd like to sample, and then spray no more than one scent per wrist. That way, your nose wont be confused. As you wear those scents throughout the day, pay attention to how they change. Scents are described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, which make up a harmonious scent accord. These notes are released over time: Top notes: Also known as the head notes, these are what you smellupon immediate application. Top notes are very strong and assertive, and often a bit citrusy. I find them to be too strong when Im in public, so I apply scents about five minutes before going outside. A scents top notes will have evaporated by then. Middle notes:Next are the middle notes, which typically last for about thirty minutes. Middle notes form the heart of a fragrance, and are usually much more well-rounded and mellow. Basenotes: A fragrances middle notes and basenotes form the real theme of a fragrance, which is why you need to give it time before you judge it. Basenotes start to come out after the first thirty minutes and will last until the scentdisappears. In addition to paying attention to how something evolves, think about what youre smelling and whether those scents are suitable for your needs. Things that smell very citrusy, floral, green, or aquatic, for example, might only be good for daytime use, or for the spring and summer seasons. Conversely, things that smell more like wood, amber, vanilla, or leather might be better for nighttime use, or for the fall and winter seasons. Whether something is right for you is as much about when you plan to wear it as it is about your personality.  Once youve picked something, the rest is easy. Storing: Fragrances are sensitive to light and heat, so store things in cool and dry places, and away from direct sunlight. On top your dresser is fine; on the dashboard of your car is not. Application: Generally speaking, you want to spray fragrances about 3-6 inches away from your body, and directly on pulse points (so neck, inner elbow, or wrist). Remember, fragrances need to react to your body, so dont apply scents to your clothes. I personally spray stuff on my wrist, and then lightly dab my wrists on my neck. (Rubbing is bad for the oils). Whatever you do, dont spray fragrances into the air and walk through the mist. That does little more than freshen up the room.  Amount: How much you apply is personal, and will depend on the strength of what youre spraying. Some things require a bit more application; some things less. Obviously: when in doubt, always err on the side of caution. If you want something to last long, just get a longer lasting scent, rather than go wild with a weak one. Finally, if you want to try out a new scent, or just develop your nose, buy samplers before you buy bottles. Doing so can be a nice way to check things out without dropping too much money. The Perfumed Court is a popular online source, and you can do a Google search forfragrance decants. You can also find good reviews at Basenotes, where theres a large online community of enthusiasts.

These notes are released over time: Top notes: Also known as the head notes, these are what you smellupon immediate application. Top notes are very strong and assertive, and often a bit citrusy. I find them to be too strong when Im in public, so I apply scents about five minutes before going outside. A scents top notes will have evaporated by then. Middle notes:Next are the middle notes, which typically last for about thirty minutes. Middle notes form the heart of a fragrance, and are usually much more well-rounded and mellow. Basenotes: A fragrances middle notes and basenotes form the real theme of a fragrance, which is why you need to give it time before you judge it. Basenotes start to come out after the first thirty minutes and will last until the scentdisappears. In addition to paying attention to how something evolves, think about what youre smelling and whether those scents are suitable for your needs. Things that smell very citrusy, floral, green, or aquatic, for example, might only be good for daytime use, or for the spring and summer seasons. Conversely, things that smell more like wood, amber, vanilla, or leather might be better for nighttime use, or for the fall and winter seasons. Whether something is right for you is as much about when you plan to wear it as it is about your personality.  Once youve picked something, the rest is easy. Storing: Fragrances are sensitive to light and heat, so store things in cool and dry places, and away from direct sunlight. On top your dresser is fine; on the dashboard of your car is not. Application: Generally speaking, you want to spray fragrances about 3-6 inches away from your body, and directly on pulse points (so neck, inner elbow, or wrist). Remember, fragrances need to react to your body, so dont apply scents to your clothes. I personally spray stuff on my wrist, and then lightly dab my wrists on my neck. (Rubbing is bad for the oils). Whatever you do, dont spray fragrances into the air and walk through the mist. That does little more than freshen up the room.  Amount: How much you apply is personal, and will depend on the strength of what youre spraying. Some things require a bit more application; some things less. Obviously: when in doubt, always err on the side of caution. If you want something to last long, just get a longer lasting scent, rather than go wild with a weak one. Finally, if you want to try out a new scent, or just develop your nose, buy samplers before you buy bottles. Doing so can be a nice way to check things out without dropping too much money. The Perfumed Court is a popular online source, and you can do a Google search forfragrance decants. You can also find good reviews at Basenotes, where theres a large online community of enthusiasts.

{"extracted_text":" The other week I went to a Sephora event to check-out their March\/April Hot Now products and was immediately blown away by Josie Marans Argan Matchmaker Serum Foundation ($42). Its a sci-fi-like foundation that looks white when you apply it on your skin and then a second later it adapts to your color to blend in seamlessly. It comes in a light and dark shade and I was standing next to a woman of color who took the dark shade, while I tried the light one and it actually worked for both of us! Seriously very cool to play with. Its got a light consistency, which Im guessing is because of the Argan oil in its formulation, so the plus is that aside from not needing to sort through a bunch of shades to find the right one for you, the Matchmaker works double duty to moisturize skin. I personally prefer a thicker formulation however, so while I dont think I will be giving up my Sensai Liquid Finish Foundation anytime soon (their Natural Beige saved me from years of less than perfect foundation for my skin tone!), there are a bunch of celebrities that could seriously use some help when it comes to matching makeup to their skin.

{"extracted_text":"Be prepared: Im pretty excited about this! I experienced crazy amazing, plentiful results from ABBAs Pure Detox Shampoo. You know how your body needs a good detoxing sometimes? Well, our hair is the same. The build-up from products, chlorine, pollution, and simple hair grease take their toll  and every so often our hair needs a chance to get back to its natural state. Well, only a good total cleansing can achieve that. Sure, the delicate shampoos are great to prevent stripping and drying, but once in awhile you need more.So how about a shampoo that is gentle, but cleans your hair so thoroughly that it is actually softer, more manageable, and more voluminous? So much so that you dont even recognize it as your own hair?! I bought this shampoo in preparation for the impending summer of swimming in pools, thinking it would be the perfect product to purify my hair of chlorine.I decided to test it out ahead of time and was blown away. My hair took on a whole new characteristic. I had thought my hair felt heavy because of its thickness  and that was why it seemed so unstylable. But I was wrong  it was all because of toxic build-up. After one shampooing my hair was as smooth and shiny as if Id just gotten a blow-out. It felt completely different  soft and feathery  something I never thought my hair could ever be. Made with molasses and baking soda, the consistency and color is just like molasses. It wafts a hint of a Chinese herbal scent, which I personally love, but it might take others some getting used to.

Loom pretty much stocks the ultimate collection of awesome, pretty much the kind of stuff that ends up on my want of the week wall.

{"extracted_text":" Fancy Friday in Black and Brown Look Left, look right, then agree that black and brown are the most awesome colour combo. Its simple and classic though it very rarely sees the light of day, till Fancy Friday that is. Then, there are the 2 tone brogues, these guys are awesome, but incredibly difficult to wear, and if the rule is that your belt matches your shoes, well then, what colour do you match? What happens if like me, you have a belt that matches neither? I simply went for a black belt and let the blazer match the shoes, it still helps getting items in your outfit talking to one another. Lets look at the details though. The camo bow tie was to pick up on the contrast collar of the blazer, its also got some black in it so helps blend in with the outfit overall I think. To be able to make this all work, together, I thought a simple white shirt with the slightest texture was best, it has a nice french cuff, so the silver on the watch and cufflink could allwork together  matching metal with metal is key, and perhaps a dressiquette post I need to wright up one day So If you like this look, below are some online choices to help get you started, the exact blazer and shoes were impossible to find.

{"extracted_text":" Fancy Friday in Grey and Brown For those of you who have been following me for a while know that my standard approach to getting dressed is picking one item and building an outfit around that. In this case it was the tie, Im a sucker for new things, and having just received a package from the gents at Weekend Casualstuffed with accessories as well as having come back from a major shopping trip in Johannesburgso I wanted to just wear ALL THE new things! I love me a tartan tie, its very versatile as you generally have 3 or 4 colours in the tie to match to different parts of your outfit, in this case I let the neutral colours in the tie form the base and built the major items around that with a neutral jacket and trousers. I took a chance with the pocket square and lapel flower, technically they shouldnt have worked, the pocket square was a little busy, and the flowers colour ever so slightly off, but in the end it was the confidence that pulled it off. Ive always said, you can wear anything if you wear it confidently right? Maybe it was confidence combined with the fact that the colours actually all worked togetherbut who can be sure.

When I was in highschool I went on two school excursions to overseas destinations (thailand and new zealand) and ever since then Ive made it a priority to travel.Some of the countries Ive been able to visit because of money Ive earnt modeling and others have been courtesy of a client booking me for a job on location. This year Ive had two job in Majorca, Spain  gorgeous place and friendly people but loads of tourists.The first job I did was for Healthy Living magazine (Germany) I flew to Majorca just to do cover tests.Early morning starts means breakfast on the run!I stayed at an amazing townhouse in the village but the crew stayed here  incredible villa with swimming pool and everything, so beautiful.Shooting at the beachthe result!The second time I flew to Majorca I was shooting a winter catalogue  and it was the height of summer! About 35C and wearing boots and knits you gotta do what you gotta do! The first days shoot was held at a huge old spanish villas that was converted in a museum. I could imagine people living there 150 years ago, it was really magical except the dungeon. It had instruments of torture in it.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-19 Another Level I didn't really want to title this post with a naff band name from the early noughties that covered Silk tracks and called it their own, but all I could really say yesterday, over and who again was \"That was AnOther Level!!!\"  I am of course speaking in reference to Simone Rocha, which in amongst a slew of brilliant things I saw yesterday, did manage to surpass the rest just because it was her on-schedule debut (discounting her shows with Fashion East) and quite literally took everyone's breath away. There was a rollercoaster giddiness felt after the show because you were so excited to witness the rise of yet another London duckling that only added to the hub-hub over LFW (I've just added yet another shoutout of \"LFW is so great\" to the chorus of articles in the latest isssue of Pop). It was somewhat of an inevitability. Her off-schedule show had people in raptures and forevermore, the contrast between white lace trapped in kinky clear PVC stamped Rocha as someone who knows a thing or two about texture games. She didn't disappoint for her A\/W 12-3 collection and refined her aesthetic even more, so much so that her MA collection seemed like a distant memory. You forget, that she's only really been four seasons in. She upped the tactability factor by looking at tribes of Papua New Guinea and then 1930s street urchin children of her native Dublin. I'm also reminded of Irish photographer Niall O'Brien's Good Rats series that depics street tribes at their most quiet and strangely beautiful. It's this mix of regal and untamed that underscores the collection. Slick mirror leather is the hard counterpart to the soft fluffy wool knit collar. A spotty print hide or sheeny shiny black ponyskin has a wildness to it that is coaxed back to elegance in a boxy oversized coat. PVC gets an burst of tufted yarns that could be likened to Papupa New Guinea tribal costume. The ladylike connotations of Melton and Linton tweed (oft used by Chanel) gets a layering of tulle to form a barrier of refinement. It's as if Rocha knows exactly when materials start looking cliched and banal and has the ability to stop them from doing so, with the wave of her texture-driven magic wand. It's this precise knack for contrast and balance that got female hearts racing in the audience. I came away wanting to dress head to toe and submerse myself completely in Rocha's work. That's a hard feat for someone who craves the mix n' match. In the shoe department, Rocha has long displayed a maturity that is beyond her years. The idea of working perspex into a brogue has the potential for becoming a design classic, as recognisable as Hussein Chalayan's wooden table skirt or Issey Miyake's Pleats Please technique. Rocha went for a pure stable of flat brogues and pumps and the perspex became a thin accent embedded in the sole, shining in clear, lime or coral. With two pairs of Simone Rocha's already in the closet, it invariably means that I'll now have to go the whole hog and continue that tradition with this season. That's no hardship considering the choice at hand.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-25 Au Revoir As beautiful as the seven bouquets arranged in perspex cases were (they're the handiwork of Antwerp-based florist Marc Calle apparently), they felt needlessly funereal at Raf Simons' finale show for Jil Sander today. I suppose they could be celebratory as well, with each bouquet representing a year of Simons' tenure at Jil Sander. The final standing ovation and the tears, genuine on the part of Simons, weirdly false when it came to certain members of the audience, too contributed to the atmosphere where we felt pressurised to mourn the loss of Simons. Was I the only one that was a little giddy, feeling like this finale was brimming with possibility?  Yes, it is an end of an era but it's also the beginning of an exciting trajectory of Simons' career. Wherever he goes or does will still be hugely influential to fashion, as his contribution to Jil Sander has been for the past seven years. I guess I never saw Raf Simons, as someone who was deadlocked to the brand of Jil Sander, despite the magnificent work he has done there and instead, he could well leave an influential imprint at two or three more places should he wish. Not that there I'm saying the show should have been devoid of emotion but let's tone down the dramatics and start anticipating what's around the corner  Raf Simons is well and alive and has the ability to take his skill and vision and apply them to any number of houses in addition to continue doing so for his own brand (Raf Simons womenswear  imagine that eh?). It is an end of sorts but also a new beginning for Simons as well as for Jil Sander, which will see the return of the brand's founder. Something else to get excited about.  The collection itself was in fact a delicate continuation of what Simons has been exploring for the past three seasons  exploring mid twentieth century couture through a sharply finessed looking glass. The delicacy of lingerie-inspired palette steered clear from what's going on in the rest of the season and had most of us swooning at how Simons had progressed to a point where he's comfortable with conveying ultra femininity in his work. It was difficult to get away from the Dior allusions, especially in the use of gravity defying volume, best seen in the coats that the models clutched together at the chest and in the gathers of fabric around the hip in synthesised corset dresses.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-24 Cornered It seems like an odd thing to have flown into Milan and on the first day, post about what is essentially a young designer initiative. I do still have a flood of NYFW\/LFW stuff to go up but all in due course. First up is a call to action by Vogue Italia and The Corner who have teamed up to present the second edition of a group of eleven designers, all given editorial and prime e-commerce positioning. Yoox Group's collaboration activites are numerous and for some reason, generally slips by unnoticed, without creating too much of a fanfare. The Vogue Talents Corner project was feted last night with all eleven designers displaying their S\/S 12 pieces, which are currently available to buy on The Corner and then a small preview of their A\/W 12-3 collection, ready for me to get stuck into discovering. Some of the names were new to me and some were familiar and thankfully all formed a potent selection that was splendidly varied. The Corner is probably one of the big e-commerce power players that does tend to go for a more directional buy in terms of its stock and so adding these eleven designers to the site feels fairly seamless. As Federico Marchetti, founder and CEO of Yoox Group pointed out, The Corner is there to take risks and for these eleven designers, hopefully the risk pays off.  Mungo Gurney  Yes, that is the designer's actual name and no, I stupidly didn't ask him where it came from. I did glean that Mungo is only one collection in and already the S\/S 12 collection is in Browns Focus, Luisa Viaroma, No.6 in New York and now The Corner. His collection is primarily print focused with an emphasis on vibrantly colour blocked swimwear. His sophomore A\/W 12-3 collection is still fairly print focused but the colours are slightly more muted and detailed. He'll be doing an event to properly present the whole collection back in London after fashion week so I'll hopefully get the chance to ask him what exactly is the deal with his name. A\/W 12-3 S\/S12:  C.B. Made in Italy  Cecilia Bringheli isn't the only brand doing slippers but her's are especially well crafted, made in a small factory in Northern Italy and designed to ensure maximum comfort for the wearer. She chooses her patterns and prints wisely and a pair adorned with a watercolour floral from the S\/S 12 collection are particularly fetching. Tweeds, checks and wools dominate her A\/W 12-3 crop of slippers but it's these richly hued suede ankle boots that look mighty appealing. A\/W 12-3: S\/S 12:  Leitmotif  I became familiar with Fabio Sasso and Juan Caro's work through their menswear collections at Pitti. I predictably fell for their prints that combined baroque and gothic inspired patterns, lifting and collaging them into imaginary landscapes. Incidentally, they've become my go to answer whenever people quiz me about up and coming designers based in Italy. Their S\/S 12 collection is a riotous trip that is saved by the fairly simple shapes.  A\/W 12-3: S\/S 12:  AI_Andrea Incontri  I already wrote about AI's S\/S 12 collection of odd uniformity and it's pleasing to see some of those pieces on TheCorner. What started off as a disciplined accessories label only recently forayed into simple garments. AI has now shifted into adding one wardrobe cornerstone at a time  first the bag, then the cotton t-shirt and now the coat  which were made in collaboration with Hapsburg, in a project that explored the shade of loden. Speckled leathers that look like stingray sparkle their way on to little pouches and wristlet bags and then on to shoes, another new addition. A\/W 12-3: S\/S 12:  Hexa by Kuho  I've attended a few of Korean-born designer Kuho Jung's shows in New York and S\/S 12 was by far my favourite one with his unusual fixation on Russian military badges. In what was a fairly minimal and precise collection, a splay of badges came bursting forth and was visually appealing in a weirdly literal sort of way.  Vernissage  You might be sick of animalia gracing jewellery but Illenia Corti and Matteo Mena don't look at the obvious species of the animal world to focus on. They sit somewhere between fine and costume jewellery, applying the principles of handcrafted, non-identikit way of working to their pieces. Everything has a precious antiqued look to it and yet there's a playfulness to pieces like the firefly ring and earrings which actually have movable wings. A\/W 12-3: S\/S 12:  Benedetta Bruzziches  The one and only pure bag label in the mix was definitely intriguing. The chesterfield inspired quilted bags looked at first like a witty take on the Chanel 2.55 but then in other parts of the collection, you have a fox head winking back at you as well as a chalk paper shopping bag complete with a to-buy list written on the side. It's hard to see what exactly is Bruzziches' bag niche but perhaps she's still finding that out herself.   A\/W 12-3: S\/S 12:  Joanne Stoker  This ex-architect turned shoe designer twinkled her way into my life when I saw her beautiful, completely NON-gimmicky shoes that have LED lights in the heels. This Cordwainers graduate impresses in her other designs that mix up unusual resinned inlays with a plainer upper. This is clever shoe collaging with stunning effects. I feel a post coming on titled \"Stoked with Stoker\" as I'm sure to revisit her work soon enough. A\/W 12-3: S\/S 12:  Ricostru  Hurrah! I score my first Guangzhou-based designer by way of Riko Manchit Au, whose label Ricostru (from the Italian word for reconstruction), seeks to readdress refined basics for the women, whilst maintaining a low carbon footprint. I got to converse in a few words of Cantonese and also find that Ricostru actually already has its own boutique in Shanghai. I also got to see the jewellery by Rosalyn Citta Paramitha, a friend of Au's with whom she studied at the Institute of Marangoni. These sculpted metal shards go hand in hand with the pure lines of the Ricostru pieces.  Pedro Lourenco  This young Brazilian designer needs little introduction as he bravely burst on to the Paris calendar a few seasons ago and is in fact, currently preparing for his proper A\/W 12-3 show. I think his pre fall collection is probably his most mature yet where glacier prints are spliced into knit dresses and wool coats are subtly dyed to look like frost had bit into the shades of blue and peach. The tricksy pieces from his S\/S 12 collection are perhaps not a true reflection of where Lourenco is at now, design-wise but we shall see in about a week's time. Pre-fall 2012: S\/S 12:  Shourouk  Shourouk's jewellery instantly caught the eye of details maven Tommy Ton, who would probably have a ball shooting some of these pieces. This Parisian-based jeweller honed her skills at Galliano and Chloe before starting out on her own and progressively becoming more daring with the composition of her bling-heavy pieces. For A\/W 12-3, she has ventured into pinked edged handbags which equally get a heavy dose of paste and sparkle that are prompting the magpie in me to hope that TheCorner will continue to support her work.

Pre-fall 2012: S\/S 12:  Shourouk  Shourouk's jewellery instantly caught the eye of details maven Tommy Ton, who would probably have a ball shooting some of these pieces. This Parisian-based jeweller honed her skills at Galliano and Chloe before starting out on her own and progressively becoming more daring with the composition of her bling-heavy pieces. For A\/W 12-3, she has ventured into pinked edged handbags which equally get a heavy dose of paste and sparkle that are prompting the magpie in me to hope that TheCorner will continue to support her work.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-02 Culinary Comforts Within a single Stockholm Fashion Week, I got to talk to not one but TWO designers about food. DOUBLE SCORE! First it was Carin Wester's abstracted Parisians bistros and brasseries and then yesterday, I began at Mathias Dahlgren's Matbaren where Rodebjer presented their A\/W 12-3 collection and ended the day, with a meal at that very same establishment, eating pig's head and pickled cucumber. A fitting end to a trip where keeping warm, seeing warmth-inducing collections and good food has gone hand in hand with each other. There was a reason why Carin Rodebjer chose that venue to show her collection. She spoke of relating to Dahlgren, drawing parallels between his harmonious food creations and her own attitude towards the sort of women that command her clothes rather than the other way round. It's with this notion in mind that she thought of men's fashion icons such as David Hockney, Jean Cocteau and Prince Michael Duke of Kent for her new collection. It wasn't that she wanted to inject menswear dress codes into the collection but it's more about the attitude and the ease with which these men inhabit their clothes that she brought to her clothes. In general, that is the raison d'tre of all Rodebjer collections but there was definitely something luxuriously comforting about the recipe that she had cooked up in Dahlgren's premises, all of which instantly looked like go-to-staples  a knee length kimono coat with arm patches, the sweaters and skirts in a texturised faux fur that from a distance looked like crushed velvet, the idea of layering up two polo necks (thanks Carin  I'm shamelessly nicking that idea to keep my neck warm in New York) and a wrapped shirt printed with garden blooms. Accessories such as the flat leather slip-ons and the A3 sized clutches (suggesting that it might hold something more substantial than a lippie and a phone) were the perfect ingredients to complete this succinctly edited wardrobe. I know it sounds like a bit of a la-di-da drone, but editing does seem to be a problem at Stockholm shows. There's no need to hammer home the point by showing EVERY single style in EVERY possible colour way. Rodebjer did no such thing. Actually, I left the show wanting more. Fortunately, Rodebjer has support from the likes of bStore in London and a very well-stocked webstore of their own. Hopefully the reality of wearing this collection feels every bit as good as my meal did at Matbaren. Steve's iPhone pics are my one boshed attempt at throwing in my secondary passion here.

Does the heart flutter over clothes? It does when faced with Muynck's charm, which came in mega doses when I visited her studio. Four interns quietly sewing away something vaguely old (Dusty Springfield perhaps?) on the radio and the room awash with dainty pastel embroidery and beading. Then you delve into the pieces in tandem with Myrza's drawings and the fluttering begins. Perhaps this won't affect anyone who doesn't have a strange love\/hate relationship with the shell suit. Hey we've all worn one. My sister and I have been subjected to some truly hideous matching shell suits (she wore pink, I wore blue) together with our parents who also wore shell suits (mum wore white, dad wore navy) and out on holiday we would go because of course, you can only get the most our of your surroundings if you have a shell suit on. I perversely liked the uniformity though. I enjoyed \"dressing up\" for sports\/leisure activities whilst not partaking in any err actual sports or leisure. The shell suit does however come loaded with a lot of naff baggage, too numerous to even list out here because I'm sure everyone will have their own set of iconic negative imagery, associated with this 80s relic. Well, Myrza has set about overturning those connotations. From her MA collection at Central Saint Martins through to her S\/S 12 collection and now to the one she's working on for Vauxhall Fashion Scout, the idea of contrasting sportswear influenced shapes and pretty-pretty embellishment has been a solid foundation. With a collaged-in-muse in mind (a young Jodie Foster pops up from time to time), she starts off with impressionistic drawings that then develops into beading or embroidery sampling. Myrza purposely strings together beads and stitches with a naivete which sounds obnoxious but is utterly charming when you see the work upclose. It's not wonky for wonky's sake. The finishing of the garments themselves is immaculate but then the hand dying and embellishments takes a slightly more rough-hewed course that works in Myrza's favour. After all a shell suit can't be spruced up to the point where it becomes entirely unrecognisable or TOO luxurious for its own good. Therefore, the slightly awkward undertones that permeate Myrza's drawings and handiwork gives her clothes a tangible reality. You can tell I desperately want to scuzz about Holloway Road wearing a head to toe Myrza look. It's hard not to fall into cliched romanticisation of 'urban grittiness' and I suppose Myrza's shell suits are a manifestation of that. I got to see some of the preliminary sketches and embroidery experimentations for the new collection which is more or less a continuation of the sort of shapes and colours that Myrza has been exploring previously with a few added textures of towelling, crochet and drawn on illustrations to go with the beading and embroidery. I don't normally go into detail posting past collections but the nature of Myrza's drawings along with her reference imagery and then the pieces themselves make it impossible not to go into picture overload. Here are both her S\/S 12 and her MA collection which are again, a continuous run of silhouettes where delicate handcrafted prettiness meets comfort and practicality. I was trying to put my finger on what was so special about the styling of Emma Watson on the cover for Elle UK in the November issue last year and along with unexpected appearance of Tsumori Chisato, Myrza's trackie top here also featured on the cover  a brave choice when that prime clothing credit could have gone to a shot-to-death advertiser.

Kind of like when I say \"OH no you DID'NT!\" and then people give me a strange look because of my mild-mannered British accent. However, I can't deny that the shoe collaborations that stood out at NYFW include Sophie Theallet's rich tri-coloured heeled oxfords and Dean Quinn's elegant ankle strap flats  both were less about angular or architectural shapes but more about a distinctive artistic take on recognisable classics.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-26 Impossible Conversations >> I never seem to be able to make it to the Met Museum in New York to catch their annual fashion exhibition biggie as it is normally timed in between fashion weeks. I very nearly spanked a ton of air miles on a ticket just to see the McQueen exhibition last year but then decided that mother Lau might want to make it to the USA one day, so I'd better save them up for a rainy day. A preview event of the upcoming Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations exhibition has wetted the appetite and may just be the primary excuse for a random trip to NY come May. The reasoning for pitting Miuccia Prada against Elsa Schiaparelli was fairly logical  both are female, Italian and both questioned the notions of good taste in their time. What stumped me was how the exhibition would be presented and how the two designers' work would interact with each other. That question was duly answered at the preview as Harold Koda and Andrew Bolton, the curators at The Costume Institute thoroughly explained the outline of the exhibition alongside a few working examples of Prada and Schiaparelli pieces.  The parallels between the work were actually far more literal than I thought they'd be. A baroque swirl on a 1937 Schiaparelli jacket matched up with another more recognisable bit of baroque on a Prada S\/S 11 dress. The use of art nouveau patterns in Prada's S\/S 08 looking uncannily like Schiaparelli's 1937-8 ensemble. What's more interesting is that it's unlikely that Miuccia ever took conscious and direct influence from Schiaparelli's work. The seven thematic themes will include Hard Chic, Ugly Chic, Naif Chic, The Classical Body, The Exotic Body and The Surreal Body. The mere fact that an exhibition includes a section entitled Ugly Chic is worth the plane ticket for me to go and take a peek and I'm glad that the curators have addressed the bravery of both designers to question sanctioned chicness. Koda recounted a little anecdote about Schiaparelli admonishing someone for making fun of her mismatched shoes by saying \"You wouldn't know chic if it hit you on the head!\" The exhibition will also explore the distinct differences between the two women in the theme \"Waist Up\/Waist Down\" with Schiaparelli gravitating towards ostentatious jackets and Prada maintaining a preference for skirts. This is quite evident in these paired up examples here that the Met provided. Whilst there are uniting features in these pairings, it's also clear that the two designers' aesthetic and process poles apart. What's more intriguing will be the videos directed by Baz Luhrmann where simulated conversations between Schiaparelli and Prada take place. The situation is of course fictitious but the words will be taken from Schiaparelli's biography and interviews that Prada has done. I can't quite visualise this part of this namesake part of the exhibition so there's really only one way of finding out how this dead and alive convo is constructed.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-21 Into the Woods If I've hit the snooze button on posting, I promise there is good reason but I was waiting for something mammoth and this was exactly that. Hopefully some of you tuned in to the stream of McQ's show last night but I know how easy it is to forget to time into a live stream so I'm hoping that you'll relish in the palpitating moments backstage before, what I thought was one of the most memorable shows I've seen in a LONG time. The excacerbated excited tingling may have been caused by the sheer opportunity that I got to go backstage in what was a fairly tight and closed set. Still, given that one of the first things that I saw when I walked in backstage was Kristen McMenamy stalking around demi-dressed in a robe and a skintight tulle top with velvet appliqued leaves, with an exaggerated coil of hair atop her head, I think exclamation mark laden excitement is well and truly called for. Let's put this McQ show into context first and foremost. It is the first time Alexander McQueen's diffusion line McQ has ever had a show. It's been about ten years since Alexander McQueen the brand has staged any sort of show in London. McQ the diffusion line, launched back in 2006 has been a dritfting label of the uber casual and denim-based offerings with a few teensy tiny hints to McQueen's house codes. Sarah Burton has now taken hold of the McQ ship to steer it into a new era, where the collection would slide up the scale, closer to the mainline and a four storey McQ store set to open in London will galvanise that shift. People on the livestream, who thought they were tuning into a proper Alexander McQueen show would be forgiven for thinking this was slightly minimal for a mainline McQueen show, when in fact this was actually a stellar McQ collection. I was well and truly floored when I saw the clothes on the rack and the collection pretty much had me when I saw McMenamy, looking hauntingly beautiful from very angle.  The final three looks with their nipped in waists and hard-edged delicacy were already a million steps up from what McQ had offered previously. If the main Alexander McQueen is about as close to haute couture as can be expected in a ready to wear line, then McQ surely had to follow suit to present itself as a collection that takes those fantastical elements and tone them down for the reality of daily wear. There wasn't a checked shirt or parka jacket in sight and yet the distinction between the two lines is testament to how intricate and artisinal Sarah Burton's work is for the mainline. McQ's clothes still looked exquisitely made but neither were they the magnificent feats of intense labour that Burton pours into say a ruffled dress made up of hundreds of circular hand massaged chiffon. For the new customer that has recently been made aware of Alexander McQueen as a brand, due to last year's festivities, McQ will present itself as a better opportunity to be within touching distance of \"proper\" McQueen.   Let's talk about THAT hair first. I'm not the best at covering beauty and hair backstage and I was definitely trying to pick up tips from the hordes hair and beauty journos. Overhearing their convo with Guido Palau, who created this incredible feat of hair manipulation, I gleaned that the look was supposed to be an exaggerated 1940s hair roll, made up of a giant hair doughnut with the model's real hair pulled up over it, which looked like a painful process. I did want to tap Guido's shoulder and say \"Hey, you remember me? You didn't want to do my hair on that Gap Christmas ad campaign because you said it looked fine as it was and I had sad panda face all day because of that.\" That would be incredibly sad and dorky though so I resisted the temptation.  The boots were also an arduous process. Thigh high with dozens of eyelets, the lacing up took about three people per model to complete. They are incidentally the first pair of thigh highs that I've wanted in a long time, which I think has something to do with the shine of the leather and the brogue-like punched detailing.  When they practised the finale, which hopefully you'll get to see in its mighty glory once McQ put up the full video, I was pretty hysterical. That's when I started manically tweeting \"Please, guys. Just watch this.\"  It was really hard not to overdose on shots of McMenamy and her closing look.  As for the rest of the collection, it ran the gamut from the pragmatic and slick military moss green coats and jackets to the fantasy of a tutu dress embroidered with flowers. Everything was waisted and tightened to the proportions that one expects from McQueen. The Black Watch tartan was more than a nod to the notorious Highland Rape collection and has actually featured in previous McQ collections but looks more polished here as a bustier dress over a lace top or as a dramatic flared out frock coat. The menswear was perhaps slightly erring on the more casual side when compared with the womenswear but that didn't lessen the direction of the show which was WWII military in spirit to begin with and then darkened into a tangible woodland fantasy where burgandy velvet devorwith leaf motifs, a rainbow cornucopia of fabric flowers and cut silk and knots of silk made to look like moss growing on a rock all take over.  The finale, as some of you will have seen, featured McMenamy emerging on to the dried leaf covered catwalk and standing there, illuminated like a Titania-esque statue with leaves falling from above. She then looks up bewildered and lost and finds nestled under the leaves, a rope that guides her to a dramatic reveal of a woodland scene and into a curious looking hut.  Then there's an unexpected blaring of techno from this hidden club, to which we were all invited in to (provided you can elbow your way in through the throng of guests) afterwards for a drink or two with McMenamy revelling in all the photo snapping and looking like she owned this joint called the Core Club. According to the receipts plastered all over the walls, there are a ton of lifetime members, perhaps an allusion to the lifelong dedicated fans of Alexander McQueen, both brand and person. That's a Core Club that you can happily sign me up to.

For the new customer that has recently been made aware of Alexander McQueen as a brand, due to last year's festivities, McQ will present itself as a better opportunity to be within touching distance of \"proper\" McQueen.    \nLet's talk about THAT hair first.  I'm not the best at covering beauty and hair backstage and I was definitely trying to pick up tips from the hordes hair and beauty journos.  Overhearing their convo with Guido Palau, who created this incredible feat of hair manipulation, I gleaned that the look was supposed to be an exaggerated 1940s hair roll, made up of a giant hair doughnut with the model's real hair pulled up over it, which looked like a painful process.  I did want to tap Guido's shoulder and say \"Hey, you remember me?  You didn't want to do my hair on that Gap Christmas ad campaign because you said it looked fine as it was and I had sad panda face all day because of that.\"  That would be incredibly sad and dorky though so I resisted the temptation.  \nThe boots were also an arduous process.  Thigh high with dozens of eyelets, the lacing up took about three people per model to complete.  They are incidentally the first pair of thigh highs that I've wanted in a long time, which I think has something to do with the shine of the leather and the brogue-like punched detailing.   \nWhen they practised the finale, which hopefully you'll get to see in its mighty glory once McQ put up the full video, I was pretty hysterical.  That's when I started manically tweeting \"Please, guys.  Just watch this.\"  \nIt was really hard not to overdose on shots of McMenamy and her closing look.  \nAs for the rest of the collection, it ran the gamut from the pragmatic and slick military moss green coats and jackets to the fantasy of a tutu dress embroidered with flowers.  Everything was waisted and tightened to the proportions that one expects from McQueen.  The Black Watch tartan was more than a nod to the notorious Highland Rape collection and has actually featured in previous McQ collections but looks more polished here as a bustier dress over a lace top or as a dramatic flared out frock coat. The menswear was perhaps slightly erring on the more casual side when compared with the womenswear but that didn't lessen the direction of the show which was WWII military in spirit to begin with and then darkened into a tangible woodland fantasy where burgandy velvet devor√© with leaf motifs, a rainbow cornucopia of fabric flowers and cut silk and knots of silk made to look like moss growing on a rock all take over.  \nThe finale, as some of you will have seen, featured McMenamy emerging on to the dried leaf covered catwalk and standing there, illuminated like a Titania-esque statue with leaves falling from above.  She then looks up bewildered and lost and finds nestled under the leaves, a rope that guides her to a dramatic reveal of a woodland scene and into a curious looking hut.  \nThen there's an unexpected blaring of techno from this hidden club, to which we were all invited in to (provided you can elbow your way in through the throng of guests) afterwards for a drink or two with McMenamy revelling in all the photo snapping and looking like she owned this joint called the Core Club.  According to the receipts plastered all over the walls, there are a ton of lifetime members, perhaps an allusion to the lifelong dedicated fans of Alexander McQueen, both brand and person.  That's a Core Club that you can happily sign me up to.       "},"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/into-the-woods.html","pipe":{"text":" 2012-02-21 Into the Woods If I've hit the snooze button on posting, I promise there is good reason but I was waiting for something mammoth and this was exactly that. Hopefully some of you tuned in to the stream of McQ's show last night but I know how easy it is to forget to time into a live stream so I'm hoping that you'll relish in the palpitating moments backstage before, what I thought was one of the most memorable shows I've seen in a LONG time. The excacerbated excited tingling may have been caused by the sheer opportunity that I got to go backstage in what was a fairly tight and closed set. Still, given that one of the first things that I saw when I walked in backstage was Kristen McMenamy stalking around demi-dressed in a robe and a skintight tulle top with velvet appliqued leaves, with an exaggerated coil of hair atop her head, I think exclamation mark laden excitement is well and truly called for. Let's put this McQ show into context first and foremost. It is the first time Alexander McQueen's diffusion line McQ has ever had a show. It's been about ten years since Alexander McQueen the brand has staged any sort of show in London. McQ the diffusion line, launched back in 2006 has been a dritfting label of the uber casual and denim-based offerings with a few teensy tiny hints to McQueen's house codes. Sarah Burton has now taken hold of the McQ ship to steer it into a new era, where the collection would slide up the scale, closer to the mainline and a four storey McQ store set to open in London will galvanise that shift. People on the livestream, who thought they were tuning into a proper Alexander McQueen show would be forgiven for thinking this was slightly minimal for a mainline McQueen show, when in fact this was actually a stellar McQ collection. I was well and truly floored when I saw the clothes on the rack and the collection pretty much had me when I saw McMenamy, looking hauntingly beautiful from very angle.  The final three looks with their nipped in waists and hard-edged delicacy were already a million steps up from what McQ had offered previously. If the main Alexander McQueen is about as close to haute couture as can be expected in a ready to wear line, then McQ surely had to follow suit to present itself as a collection that takes those fantastical elements and tone them down for the reality of daily wear. There wasn't a checked shirt or parka jacket in sight and yet the distinction between the two lines is testament to how intricate and artisinal Sarah Burton's work is for the mainline. McQ's clothes still looked exquisitely made but neither were they the magnificent feats of intense labour that Burton pours into say a ruffled dress made up of hundreds of circular hand massaged chiffon.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-09 Louis Vuitton: The Secret (and not so secret) Places I'm quite tickled with the fact that my fashion month has been given a sense of symmetry courtesy of Louis Vuitton, who invited me out yesterday to Paris to discover a few \"secret places\" which is succinctly summarised in the video above, unlike this beast of a post that I'm typing up at 3am after freshly landing in New York. So it is to be that Louis Vuitton will both kickstart and conclude my fashion month as of course in a month's time, in Paris in a month's time there'll be another show extravaganza as well as the opening of the new Louis Vuitton Marc Jacobs exhibition. A dusting of snow and a stunning view from the Ritz is just the sort of insanely picturesque start that this month needs. .. The craftsmanship and heritage aspects of Louis Vuitton aren't things that are necessarily sidelined. In fact, they're at the forefront of Louis Vuitton's marketing and advertising campaigns at times. Remember the ad featuring a woman hand stitching a bag that got banned in the UK? I personally never felt like the ad was wholly deceptive and rather, it was pointing out that there are in fact \"petites mains\" involved in the hundred stage process of constructing a Louis Vuitton bag or trunk. Now that I've witnessed these hands at work, I'm even more convinced that the ad didn't deserve to be banned. Despite that ad glitch, the concept of savoir faire has never been more spotlit than it is now, what with Louis Vuitton's newly relaunched website that features languid videos honing in on the intricacies of process. Specifically for Louis Vuitton, this shift in spotlighting craftsmanship is a retaliation against the counterfeit behemoth that they face. Cynically, you could also say that it is part of the rise of exposing what goes on behind the scenes as a marketing strategy, something which I've defended in the past. I reiterate here  as long as the show of craftsmanship is a genuine one, I see nothing wrong in how brands divulge that information.  On a more personal level, my relationship with Louis Vuitton on this blog has been needlessly fractious. From a Along with Kristin of The Clothes Whisperer, we ventured out to the Parisian suburb Asnires, where Louis Vuitton set up his workshop in 1859. Until 1977, the Asnires workshop was actually the sole Louis Vuitton production facility in the world. Louis Vuitton also added two pretty brickwork houses by the workshop, which were then lived by subsequent generations of the Vuitton family. Somewhere in this pic, three generations of the Vuitton family are present  Louis Vuitton, his son Georges and his son Gaston, who I believe is lying on the famous fold-out bed-in-a-trunk. The only well-distributed and recognisable imagery of designer's houses\/apartments are that of Coco Chanel. A good number of bloggers, journalists and guests have now frequented the famous apartment on Rue Cambon. This isn't the case for the Vuitton family home in Asnires (although I have to cite Bag Snob, who did visit the site two years ago) so it was such a delight to step into a reception room bathed in natural light, beautiful Art Nouveau curves and to discover an individualistic decor that was outrageous at the time, but became outmoded rather quickly. Within this beautifully preserved Belle Epoque room, features like the pistachio naturalistic curls and peach hued florals look fresh and exciting again. The stained glass windows done by Paul-Louis Janin in 1900 are particularly stunning. Not sure if LVMH have the power to command natural light but the day was pretty much spot-on weather wise in terms of seeing this room at its best situ. A note about the monogram, hardcore Louis Vuitton-ers will know that it wasn't actually created by Louis Vuitton nor was it the first bit of LV insignia. The checked Damier print actually came first and then to prevent counterfeiting (oh the irony), Georges Louis came up with the monogram in 1896. The blue ceramic fireplace was also another strong feature in the room. At this point, the inner Antiques Roadshow geek was coming out and I started to run my hands over things, whilst nearly passing ridiculous comments on how good the condition was. The same can be said for this marquetry bureau. I might need to learn some print clashing skills off it as I counted at least ten different geometric patterns, all created by intricate wood marquetry. Our guide pointed out the faint similarities between some of the marquetry and the LV monogram, which could well have been a source of inspiration for the final iconic monogram pattern. I also nearly started saying things like \"Oooh! That's a lovely period feature\", in manner of picky house hunters in London, who want period features but don't actually know what erm period they mean. The fluidity of the plaster stucco work gave the room a sense of movement and honestly, without wanting to sound like I'm gushing, when the light came in, it was pretty magical. The little semi-circles in the stained glass windows apparently enabled taskmaster Vuitton to oversee his workers in the workshop across from the house without them being able to look inside the house. Here, Marc Jacobs is pictured with Patrick Vuitton, Louis Vuitton's great, great grandson, who now heads up the workshop in Asnires, creating special orders for customers. We then went up inside the little travel museum, which has some of Vuittons' earliest flat trunk specimens. It seems silly now that a flat top and bottomed trunk could be considered an innovation in travel but in fact, all trunks beforehand came with a rounded top (to allow for water run-off). The museum neatly sums up the various patternations that Louis Vuitton and his son created  the brown and white stripe, the Damier check and then the famous monogram. Another example of Oriental marquetry (I'm using the word in the stylistic sense) again reasserts an inspiration link to the inception of the monogram.  This early steamer bag with its tricolor logo was recently revived and lifted as inspiration by Kim Jones in his S\/S 12 debut for Louis Vuitton menswear. It says a lot that as I apparoched this bit in the museum, I said \"It's the famous packaway bed!\". It seems unlikely that a creaky old pack-away bed has become an iconic Louis Vuitton archive image, due to it being widely seen in various touring exhibitions. I suppose it sums up the assertion that Louis Vuitton has and still is essentially a business based on travel, a practical point that sometimes gets lost when we think of Louis Vuitton and its hype-built shows, campaigns and luxurious image. .. After the tour of the house, we then ventured into the atelier, which has been downscaled from what it once was, as it now concentrates on making all the hard framed luggage, special order pieces, exotic leather bags as well as the fashion show bags. I'm pleased to say though that in another part of, Asnires Louis Vuitton are training up a new generation of people to work at Louis Vuitton's atelier, something that I vehemently believe in and support. This workshop makes 250 special items or so a year which doesn't sound like a lot but the demand has never been higher and the dedication and time that each object requires hasn't diminished either, and so the need for new blood to come through the workshop is rightfully being addressed. There was a bit of a strict policy with photographing and as the workers were also finishing up (they clock off VERY promptly at 5), I couldn't get the full scope of images that I normally do when I go to a factory\/workshop. Sadly, I couldn't follow the make of a bag from beginning to end but I guess it's testament to how many processes there are involved in the making of a bag, that I couldn't even physically follow their every single move with my camera. Here, carpenters are constructing the foundation boxes made out of popular and reinforced with beechwood as the basis of the luggage. I love these handwritten dimensions, passed down from Vuitton's instructions, which haven't actually changed that much. In the warm leather storage area, we got a feel for all the supple lush skins that Louis Vuitton get in for their bags and for future styles, it looks to be extremely colourful. The Epi leather is probably my favourite 'iconic' Louis Vuitton leathers\/finishes just because its patina is so subtle yet immediately recognisable at the same time. Here's a stack of that nude leather that is used to make the handles, the straps and the trims of a lot of Louis Vuitton bags. This was one of the \"fake\" rules that I learnt about Louis Vuitton bag back  that if it's a fake, the nude leather won't colour or take on an aged patina over time. We then saw the exotic skins section, where I was admonished for touching these insanely expensive pieces that would then be made up into bags. Asnires is the only place where Louis Vuitton's exotic skin bags are made so I rightfully deserved to be reprimanded considering how expensive some of them are. Here are some stingray and python skins. What I didn't know was that the shiny sheen on a croc or alligator skin is actually created by rolling an agate stone over the skin until it takes on a shine. Again, we weren't allowed to take pictures but basically a leather cutting machine controlled by lasers expertly cuts the leather pieces to make up the bags and thus reduces wastage because of its accuracy. Going back to that banned \"Handmade\" advert, it seems to me that whilst machines are used at Louis Vuitton, without the judgement and expertise of a human being, there's no way of producing the bags. Working the laser-cutting machine and a leather sewing machine is an admirable skill in itself. I didn't see any fully automated processes and in the latter stages especially with the saddle stitched handles and the hammering of the nails into the luggage, you end up with products that have been touched by many more human hands than mechanic probes. Each piece of luggage comes with a working lock and if you're lucky enough to own several pieces of luggage, you can co-ordinate the locks so that one key opens up all of them. The hand-eye coordination work got especially intense when it came to the hammering and trimming the trunks. The little nails are hammered in by hand and judged by eye to get the spacing right. Upstairs was where a lot of the trunks were getting finished, prepped and ready to be shipped off. Some people were also creating the special orders that comes through the atelier. This article here is a feature on Patrick Vuitton and talksa bout some of the weird requests that Vuitton has received ranging from an iPod and speaker case for Karl Lagerfeld, to a little leather case for someone to hold their rubber duck. The designs, whilst far fetched do have some limitations though. I refuse to design furniture, Patrick explains. We are in the business of movement. Nothing is made by our master craftsmen that cannot be easily transported. This trunk here is therefore the maximum size Louis Vuitton can make and if it ain't got a handle on it, they're definitely not making it. On a mezzanine floor where the noise level plummets to a near silence is the exotic skins atelier. It's quiet because the level of concentration here is soaringly high. The expense of these skins weighs heavily on the shoulders of the workers and thus the responsibility to turn out a superbly finished, finely tuned product is definitely evident. A small production line of Sofia Coppola for Louis Vuitton's bag in black alligator. Yup, still looking incredibly covetable despite their unfinished state. Helmut Newton's image of a Crocodile Eating Ballerina from Pina Bausch's ballet in 1983 concludes these educational steps into learning about the atelier process at Louis Vuitton. If anything, I already knew vaguely what steps were involved in the making of Vuitton products, but the pride of the workers was something that was more unexpected. We weren't allowed to photograph their faces but they were happy to show off what they were working on, no matter how minute each step was. I only wish I could have spent more time there before they all started clocking off. .. I thought a visit to the Champs Elysee mahussive flagship store in Paris wouldn't be anything new but seeing as my last visit was back in 2006 when I came out all indignant and huffy, this time round, I got a refresher class on the store. For a start, I missed the 20 metre high atrium where steel rods cascade down along with a flood of natural light. I think this was built in 2007 when the store was expanded and redone by the architects Peter Marino and Eric Carlson. I didn't see these floating trunks along the wall on the ground floor I didn't know Louis Vuitton published paperbacks of some choice classics I didn't think that they'd still be reproducing the pack-away bed-in-the-trunk for the modern customer. The store manager said \"It can be for someone who wants a bed in their garden!\" It's definitely an intangible cloud cuckoo land when people have foldaway beds in their gardens that probably cost more than their actual bed but still, if you can afford it, why not? I also didn't see that the doorway is flanked by two red columns of red LV luggage as a tribute to their Chinese customers. Yes, Chinese customers still flood into the store and buy at a rampant pace. I don't think they're into buying up anything and everything that is monogrammed anymore. I'm told that the Damier in fact has overtaken the monogram in the last few years as the more popular choice. I missed this cruise collection print which does cheesily feature a lot of postcard moments but I quite like the white tippex feel of the print. In ready to wear, I also spied a pair of python culottes. Why stop at leather culottes (i.e. my ASOS ones) when I can have ones in light python as well? \/\/ The more discreet bag options are available at the store's made to order lounges where you can choose your leathers and linings for a bag that doesn't scream \"LV\". We also got a little lesson in how to pack our luggage. Well, how to pack Louis Vuitton luggage specifically. I didn't learn anything especially new other than our packing guide, reminded me that I should stuff my shoes with socks and belts so that they keep their shape in the cases and also, if you're folding shirts, turn up the collars and stuff the arms with rolls of tissue paper, so they don't get creased. The final part of our \"Secret Places\" tour ended at the Espace Culturel on the top floor of the store. This part really was a secret as we weren't allowed to take pictures but it's also an art gallery that is entirely open to the walk-in public so in this sense, so this is effectively a place that everyone can enjoy. Just taking the lift designed by Olafur Eliasson is 40 seconds well spent. You enter the lift and once the doors close, it's entirely blacked out so that you can't see a thing and your earing becomes muffled because of the padded walls. It's a deathly quiet 40 seconds  either filled with tranquility or clastrophobia depending on the person. I rather enjoyed it. If I'm honest, I wasn't expecting such a well-curated exhibition at the Espace Culturel. Fashion brands supporting and collaborating with the field of art isn't anything new and there's a sense of tokenism about brands that \"dabble\" in the art field. However, Louis Vuitton hasn't been dabbling. The Espace Culturel goes out of its way to support up and coming artists to create emphatic exhibitions that, whilst they are all themed around Louis Vuitton's moniker of travel, the resulting works are expansive in scope and execution. The current exhibition Anichroes explores the musical instrument and its impact first as an object and vehicle of sound all by itself, then as a discourse of interaction with the player. It's all intriguing and interactive and again I could have spent longer. As an art space in its own right, it's definitely worth escaping the doldrum of Champ Elysee and losing yourself for a moment on the way up. ","similarity":{"text":"1,00","title":"0,18"},"gold":{"title":"Louis Vuitton: The Secret (and not so secret) Places","text":"2012-02-09\nI'm quite tickled with the fact that my fashion month has been given a sense of symmetry courtesy of Louis Vuitton, who invited me out yesterday to Paris to discover a few \"secret places\" which is succinctly summarised in the video above, unlike this beast of a post that I'm typing up at 3am after freshly landing in New York.  So it is to be that Louis Vuitton will both kickstart and conclude my fashion month as of course in a month's time, in Paris in a month's time there'll be another show extravaganza as well as the opening of the new Louis Vuitton Marc Jacobs exhibition.  A dusting of snow and a stunning view from the Ritz is just the sort of insanely picturesque start that this month needs. \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nThe craftsmanship and heritage aspects of Louis Vuitton aren't things that are necessarily sidelined.  In fact, they're at the forefront of Louis Vuitton's marketing and advertising campaigns at times.  Remember the ad featuring a woman hand stitching a bag that got banned in the UK?  I personally never felt like the ad was wholly deceptive and rather, it was pointing out that there are in fact \"petites mains\" involved in the hundred stage process of constructing a Louis Vuitton bag or trunk.  Now that I've witnessed these hands at work, I'm even more convinced that the ad didn't deserve to be banned.  Despite that ad glitch, the concept of savoir faire has never been more spotlit than it is now, what with Louis Vuitton's newly relaunched website that features languid videos honing in on the intricacies of process.  Specifically for Louis Vuitton, this shift in spotlighting craftsmanship is a retaliation against the counterfeit behemoth that they face.  Cynically, you could also say that it is part of the rise of exposing what goes on behind the scenes as a marketing strategy, something which I've defended in the past.  I reiterate here \u2013 as long as the show of craftsmanship is a genuine one, I see nothing wrong in how brands divulge that information.   \nOn a more personal level, my relationship with Louis Vuitton on this blog has been needlessly fractious.  From a childish rant back in 2006where I got irritated with Hong Kong acquaintances buying up monogrammed goods like there was no tomorrow, I've come to contradict myself and lust certain ready to wear collections with gusto \u2013 namely S\/S 10 and of course the current pastel takeover of S\/S 12.  This post is therefore some sort of reconcilation.  I'm no longer that angry teenager that thinks fashion brands are evil fat cats or that buying a designer handbag is the downfall of mankind.  The saturation of Louis Vuitton monogrammed products is of course in no way representative of what Louis Vuitton as a brand, stands for as a whole and connecting what they do today with how Mr Louis Vuitton began in 1854 seems even more relevant as the brand looks back to their history with their upcoming exhibition. \nAlong with Kristin of The Clothes Whisperer, we ventured out to the Parisian suburb Asni√®res, where Louis Vuitton set up his workshop in 1859.  Until 1977, the Asni√®res workshop was actually the sole Louis Vuitton production facility in the world.  Louis Vuitton also added two pretty brickwork houses by the workshop, which were then lived by subsequent generations of the Vuitton family. \nSomewhere in this pic, three generations of the Vuitton family are present \u2013 Louis Vuitton, his son Georges and his son Gaston, who I believe is lying on the famous fold-out bed-in-a-trunk. \nThe only well-distributed and recognisable imagery of designer's houses\/apartments are that of Coco Chanel.  A good number of bloggers, journalists and guests have now frequented the famous apartment on Rue Cambon.  This isn't the case for the Vuitton family home in Asni√®res (although I have to cite Bag Snob, who did visit the site two years ago) so it was such a delight to step into a reception room bathed in natural light, beautiful Art Nouveau curves and to discover an individualistic decor that was outrageous at the time, but became outmoded rather quickly.  Within this beautifully preserved Belle Epoque room, features like the pistachio naturalistic curls and peach hued florals look fresh and exciting again. \nThe stained glass windows done by Paul-Louis Janin in 1900 are particularly stunning.  Not sure if LVMH have the power to command natural light but the day was pretty much spot-on weather wise in terms of seeing this room at its best situ. \nA note about the monogram, hardcore Louis Vuitton-ers will know that it wasn't actually created by Louis Vuitton nor was it the first bit of LV insignia.  The checked Damier print actually came first and then to prevent counterfeiting (oh the irony\u2026), Georges Louis came up with the monogram in 1896. \nThe blue ceramic fireplace was also another strong feature in the room.  At this point, the inner Antiques Roadshow geek was coming out and I started to run my hands over things, whilst nearly passing ridiculous comments on how good the condition was. \nThe same can be said for this marquetry bureau.  I might need to learn some print clashing skills off it as I counted at least ten different geometric patterns, all created by intricate wood marquetry.  Our guide pointed out the faint similarities between some of the marquetry and the LV monogram, which could well have been a source of inspiration for the final iconic monogram pattern. \nI also nearly started saying things like \"Oooh!  That's a lovely period feature\", in manner of picky house hunters in London, who want period features but don't actually know what erm\u2026 period they mean.  The fluidity of the plaster stucco work gave the room a sense of movement and honestly, without wanting to sound like I'm gushing, when the light came in, it was pretty magical. \nThe little semi-circles in the stained glass windows apparently enabled taskmaster Vuitton to oversee his workers in the workshop across from the house without them being able to look inside the house.\nHere, Marc Jacobs is pictured with Patrick Vuitton, Louis Vuitton's great, great grandson, who now heads up the workshop in Asni√®res, creating special orders for customers. \nWe then went up inside the little travel museum, which has some of Vuittons' earliest flat trunk specimens.  It seems silly now that a flat top and bottomed trunk could be considered an innovation in travel but in fact, all trunks beforehand came with a rounded top (to allow for water run-off).  The museum neatly sums up the various patternations that Louis Vuitton and his son created \u2013 the brown and white stripe, the Damier check and then the famous monogram.  Another example of Oriental marquetry (I'm using the word in the stylistic sense) again reasserts an inspiration link to the inception of the monogram.   \nThis early steamer bag with its tricolor logo was recently revived and lifted as inspiration by Kim Jones in his S\/S 12 debut for Louis Vuitton menswear. \nIt says a lot that as I apparoched this bit in the museum, I said \"It's the famous packaway bed!\".  It seems unlikely that a creaky old pack-away bed has become an iconic Louis Vuitton archive image, due to it being widely seen in various touring exhibitions.  I suppose it sums up the assertion that Louis Vuitton has and still is essentially a business based on travel, a practical point that sometimes gets lost when we think of Louis Vuitton and its hype-built shows, campaigns and luxurious image.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nAfter the tour of the house, we then ventured into the atelier, which has been downscaled from what it once was, as it now concentrates on making all the hard framed luggage, special order pieces, exotic leather bags as well as the fashion show bags.  I'm pleased to say though that in another part of, Asni√®res Louis Vuitton are training up a new generation of people to work at Louis Vuitton's atelier, something that I vehemently believe in and support.  This workshop makes 250 special items or so a year which doesn't sound like a lot but the demand has never been higher and the dedication and time that each object requires hasn't diminished either, and so the need for new blood to come through the workshop is rightfully being addressed.\nThere was a bit of a strict policy with photographing and as the workers were also finishing up (they clock off VERY promptly at 5), I couldn't get the full scope of images that I normally do when I go to a factory\/workshop.  Sadly, I couldn't follow the make of a bag from beginning to end but I guess it's testament to how many processes there are involved in the making of a bag, that I couldn't even physically follow their every single move with my camera.\nHere, carpenters are constructing the foundation boxes made out of popular and reinforced with beechwood as the basis of the luggage.  I love these handwritten dimensions, passed down from Vuitton's instructions, which haven't actually changed that much. \nIn the warm leather storage area, we got a feel for all the supple lush skins that Louis Vuitton get in for their bags and for future styles, it looks to be extremely colourful. \nThe Epi leather is probably my favourite 'iconic' Louis Vuitton leathers\/finishes just because its patina is so subtle yet immediately recognisable at the same time. \nHere's a stack of that nude leather that is used to make the handles, the straps and the trims of a lot of Louis Vuitton bags.  This was one of the \"fake\" rules that I learnt about Louis Vuitton bag back \u2013 that if it's a fake, the nude leather won't colour or take on an aged patina over time. \nWe then saw the exotic skins section, where I was admonished for touching these insanely expensive pieces that would then be made up into bags.  Asni√®res is the only place where Louis Vuitton's exotic skin bags are made so I rightfully deserved to be reprimanded considering how expensive some of them are.  Here are some stingray and python skins. \nWhat I didn't know was that the shiny sheen on a croc or alligator skin is actually created by rolling an agate stone over the skin until it takes on a shine. \nAgain, we weren't allowed to take pictures but basically a leather cutting machine controlled by lasers expertly cuts the leather pieces to make up the bags and thus reduces wastage because of its accuracy.  Going back to that banned \"Handmade\" advert, it seems to me that whilst machines are used at Louis Vuitton, without the judgement and expertise of a human being, there's no way of producing the bags.  Working the laser-cutting machine and a leather sewing machine is an admirable skill in itself.  I didn't see any fully automated processes and in the latter stages especially with the saddle stitched handles and the hammering of the nails into the luggage, you end up with products that have been touched by many more human hands than mechanic probes. \nEach piece of luggage comes with a working lock and if you're lucky enough to own several pieces of luggage, you can co-ordinate the locks so that one key opens up all of them. \nThe hand-eye coordination work got especially intense when it came to the hammering and trimming the trunks.  The little nails are hammered in by hand and judged by eye to get the spacing right. \nUpstairs was where a lot of the trunks were getting finished, prepped and ready to be shipped off.  Some people were also creating the special orders that comes through the atelier.  This article here is a feature on Patrick Vuitton and talksa bout some of the weird requests that Vuitton has received ranging from an iPod and speaker case for Karl Lagerfeld, to a little leather case for someone to hold their rubber duck.  The designs, whilst far fetched do have some limitations though.  \u201AÄúI refuse to design furniture,\u201AÄù Patrick explains. \u201AÄúWe are in the business of movement.  Nothing is made by our master craftsmen that cannot be easily transported.\u201AÄù\nThis trunk here is therefore the maximum size Louis Vuitton can make and if it ain't got a handle on it, they're definitely not making it. \nOn a mezzanine floor where the noise level plummets to a near silence is the exotic skins atelier.  It's quiet because the level of concentration here is soaringly high.  The expense of these skins weighs heavily on the shoulders of the workers and thus the responsibility to turn out a superbly finished, finely tuned product is definitely evident. \nA small production line of Sofia Coppola for Louis Vuitton's bag in black alligator.  Yup, still looking incredibly covetable despite their unfinished state. \nHelmut Newton's image of a Crocodile Eating Ballerina from Pina Bausch's ballet in 1983 concludes these educational steps into learning about the atelier process at Louis Vuitton.  If anything, I already knew vaguely what steps were involved in the making of Vuitton products, but the pride of the workers was something that was more unexpected.  We weren't allowed to photograph their faces but they were happy to show off what they were working on, no matter how minute each step was.  I only wish I could have spent more time there before they all started clocking off.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nI thought a visit to the Champs Elysee mahussive flagship store in Paris wouldn't be anything new but seeing as my last visit was back in 2006 when I came out all indignant and huffy, this time round, I got a refresher class on the store.  For a start, I missed the 20 metre high atrium where steel rods cascade down along with a flood of natural light.

We weren't allowed to photograph their faces but they were happy to show off what they were working on, no matter how minute each step was. I only wish I could have spent more time there before they all started clocking off. .. I thought a visit to the Champs Elysee mahussive flagship store in Paris wouldn't be anything new but seeing as my last visit was back in 2006 when I came out all indignant and huffy, this time round, I got a refresher class on the store. For a start, I missed the 20 metre high atrium where steel rods cascade down along with a flood of natural light. I think this was built in 2007 when the store was expanded and redone by the architects Peter Marino and Eric Carlson. I didn't see these floating trunks along the wall on the ground floor I didn't know Louis Vuitton published paperbacks of some choice classics I didn't think that they'd still be reproducing the pack-away bed-in-the-trunk for the modern customer. The store manager said \"It can be for someone who wants a bed in their garden!\" It's definitely an intangible cloud cuckoo land when people have foldaway beds in their gardens that probably cost more than their actual bed but still, if you can afford it, why not? I also didn't see that the doorway is flanked by two red columns of red LV luggage as a tribute to their Chinese customers. Yes, Chinese customers still flood into the store and buy at a rampant pace. I don't think they're into buying up anything and everything that is monogrammed anymore. I'm told that the Damier in fact has overtaken the monogram in the last few years as the more popular choice. I missed this cruise collection print which does cheesily feature a lot of postcard moments but I quite like the white tippex feel of the print. In ready to wear, I also spied a pair of python culottes. Why stop at leather culottes (i.e. my ASOS ones) when I can have ones in light python as well? \/\/ The more discreet bag options are available at the store's made to order lounges where you can choose your leathers and linings for a bag that doesn't scream \"LV\". We also got a little lesson in how to pack our luggage. Well, how to pack Louis Vuitton luggage specifically. I didn't learn anything especially new other than our packing guide, reminded me that I should stuff my shoes with socks and belts so that they keep their shape in the cases and also, if you're folding shirts, turn up the collars and stuff the arms with rolls of tissue paper, so they don't get creased. The final part of our \"Secret Places\" tour ended at the Espace Culturel on the top floor of the store. This part really was a secret as we weren't allowed to take pictures but it's also an art gallery that is entirely open to the walk-in public so in this sense, so this is effectively a place that everyone can enjoy. Just taking the lift designed by Olafur Eliasson is 40 seconds well spent. You enter the lift and once the doors close, it's entirely blacked out so that you can't see a thing and your earing becomes muffled because of the padded walls. It's a deathly quiet 40 seconds  either filled with tranquility or clastrophobia depending on the person. I rather enjoyed it. If I'm honest, I wasn't expecting such a well-curated exhibition at the Espace Culturel. Fashion brands supporting and collaborating with the field of art isn't anything new and there's a sense of tokenism about brands that \"dabble\" in the art field. However, Louis Vuitton hasn't been dabbling. The Espace Culturel goes out of its way to support up and coming artists to create emphatic exhibitions that, whilst they are all themed around Louis Vuitton's moniker of travel, the resulting works are expansive in scope and execution. The current exhibition Anichroes explores the musical instrument and its impact first as an object and vehicle of sound all by itself, then as a discourse of interaction with the player. It's all intriguing and interactive and again I could have spent longer. As an art space in its own right, it's definitely worth escaping the doldrum of Champ Elysee and losing yourself for a moment on the way up.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-05 MA Kick Off London College of Fashion kicks off the year of MA\/BA shows with names, names and more names to vaguely remember for the future. Though it's like that it's the ideas, a particular motifs or a technique that lingers longer in memory. LCF's MA exhibition at Bloomsbury House,showcasing the final projects of the fashion artefact, digital fashion, fashion curation and footwear to name but a few, just gets bigger and better, year on year. So much so, that I've had to split out my posts on both the exhibition at the MA show which was held once again at the V&A's Raphael Hall last Thursday. I'll kick off with fashion artefact and footwear design, the part of the exhibition that was particularly impressive not only because the designs left an impression but also that they had real sustainable legs. You forgot that these were MA graduate projects but looked at them as though they were viable products, ready to go to market and that was the case for a lot of the students anyway which makes it doubly exciting to watch out for.  .. Ruth Holland (MA Fashion Artefact) The upcycling concept of putting rubbish to good use isn't anything new but you would never guess that Ruth Holland's pastel hued neck confectionary was made out of industrial waste materials. String and plastic cording find their way into multi-coloured configurations that are twisted together with traditional rope-making techniques. It's the delicious application of colour that really transforms this waste into something special.  .. Linda Holten Ramsvik(MA Fashion Artefact) LCF has seen some real travel bag gems come through in the last few years such as Sarah Williams and her unexpectedly cuved handmade luggage. Linda Holten Ramsvik looks to add herself to that category with her final project that was inspired by travelling and the multi-purpose needs for the modern day bag carrier. Proving her point, I myself was carrying a heavy DSLR, a leather tote bag and a smaller handbag. Her creations here negates that need with her two or even three in one bags. Safari waistcoats come with a hood and huge pockets. A sunglasses carrier holds four glasses. A granny grocery trolley gets a neat transformation into something sleek (I secretly wish I could get away with a granny trolley, what with my weak wrists). Texture in the form of deconstructed Norwegian embroidery prevents the line-up from looking too flat.  .. Hoon Chung(MA Fashion Footwear) 3D printing is slowly cropping up in fashion in a way that means anytime soon, I'm going to have to go and see it for myself because I still can't quite believe that a 3D object with facets, curves and highly specific shapes can be printed out. The very word print throws me off entirely. Hoon Chung's 3D printed shoes opens up the eyes to the possibility of a pair of shoes coming out of a \"printer\". They're very much in line with the sort of thoughtful innovation that the likes of Helen Furber worked on when she was at LCF, rethinking the traditional shoe makine process and pushing the field forward into an unpredictable place.  .. Anne Gammelgaard (MA Fashion Artefact) Not every graduate approached their final project with the goal to put out a commercial collection of products. Anne Gammelgaard based her artefact design on a character  a thing-finder rooting through a post-apocalyptic scenario to create instruments that will aid her on her special mission. It's as if Gammelgaard is writing a film and creating the props for it with complete conviction. As per her character's story, all the materials are found which shows the breadth of what upcycling can really do.  .. Cat Potter (MA Fashion Footwear) Cat Potter's wooden \"shoes\" landed in my inbox a while back and they got me salivated for the exhibition if her peers were going to be anywhere near as focused as her collection. Working with University College London and their 3-axis milling machines, normally used in architecture to create much larger scale building components, Cat wanted to bypass the conventional shoe components and create an object out of wood that would gradually build up from a rectangular block to a more shoe-like sandal shape. Functionality wasn't the goal here as Cat wanted to explore an entirely alternative mode of construction. Blending in furniture and architecture into footwear isn't entirely new but it's interesting that these \"shoes\" take the methodology behind those aforementioned fields and applies them to footwear. It's an extreme that can really only be appreciated when you see Cat's future work which hopefully we will see more of.  .. Christina Hamilton (MA Fashion Artefact) If I had passed Christina Hamilton's work a year ago, I might not have been as interested in her saddlery led bike accessories. The Tweed Run experience of last year and the fact that Steve has just got himself a handsome new bike makes Christina's work suddenly all the more relevant. Not that she needs fairweather cyclists like myself. Whether it's down to Boris bikes or not, London is a cyclist-heavy city and handsome accessories that don't sacrifice aesthetic for functionality will only become higher in demand. Christina hopes to develop a business out of her leather bike wares that are made using traditional saddlery techniques and on the bikes at the exhibition, her pieces already looked like they were ready to hit the road.    .. Chi Yuen (MA Fashion Footwear) I actually met Chi (also called Cherry) back in 2008 in San Francisco as part of the Arts of Fashion competition. She was doing womenswear back then but has refocused on footwear and has since gained work experience at the likes of Celine and Alexander Wang. Her graduate collection is really geared towards launching a solo brand. The warped and draped leather as well as the ruching of fur are unexpected details in this highly polished collection. These extremities are tempered enough to the point where you can already see them walking down the street, a recurring theme with a lot of the MA Fashion Artefacts\/Footwear graduates.   .. Jen Wang (MA Fashion Artefact) I was trying to rack my brains to see whether previous LCF fashion artefacts students had done sunglasses and in fact Jen Wang is the first one to do it. It was also the first time I'd ever tried on anything at a graduate exhibition which made the reality of Jen Wang bringing these glasses to production, all the more appealing. Based on bipolar personalities and the sunglasses as a face-changer, these highly complex designs really put Wang's sunglasses in a different league from the bulk of standardised frames that exist. Designers sunglasses so often rely on the strength of a brand or a logo and Jen Wang really opens up the opportunties of pushing sunnies to becoming the central focus rather than the tack-on accessory. Incidentally, it was also in China that Jen made these exquisite sunglasses, which sheds light on how the Made in China label will inevitably change in the future. Another Wang to add into the fashion fold would be no bad thing if we were able to get our mitts on sunglasses of this ilk.

{"extracted_text":" 2012-02-13 Made Abroad There were two awesome parties going on Saturday night. One was down in my hotel lobby at the Tribeca Grand. The other was in my head, a continual buzz of high after seeing a trio that had transplanted themselves to Milk Made. For those not familiar with New York Fashion Week's schedule structure. Basically you have all the razzy dazzy shows up at the Lincoln Centre, a scattering of them dotted around galleries in Chelsea, a few off site shows in wildly downtown\/uptown locations and then a concentration of cool happening at Milk Studios, what was formerly known as Mac Milk is now rebranded as Milk Made schedule. It's also the place where I happen to spend most of my NYFW week because season after season, they welcome up and coming designers into their fold and provide them with the infrastructure to put on a show or a presentation. You end up with a mix of semi-established, up and coming as well as static accessories designers showing their wares. It's a lot of bang for your buck basically.  On Saturday, Milk Made welcomed two new designers into their circle, both from out of town, not that it matters a jot. This is New York of course, city of opportunity and new beginnings. Calla from Paris (originally from Canada), Ostwald Helgason from London (originally from Iceland and Germany) join Dean Quinn, ex-resident of London (originally from Ireland) to form a trio of out-of-towners that together made my night. Search all of them on the sidebar to the right, and ye will find multiple posts on all of them dating back to the early days of Style Bubble when images were a lot smaller and words peppered with one too many exclamation mark. Still, I feel like reverting to bad habits!!!!!!!! I was well and truly excited to see all of them evolve and excite the crowd in New York. The openness of the presentations basically means anybody who's vaguely interested can walk in and check it out, so there was a lot of raw enthusiasm with people bouncing from one room to the other on the eight floor. .. First up was Calla, whose feminine and abstracted digital prints I've always had a soft spot for. She hasn't strayed too far from that territory and if anything the Leith Clark's styling accentuated the girlish charm of Calla Haynes's print work which this season distorted wood grains and granite flecks so that they almost looked like florals from afar or torrid ink blots on wet paper. The wood grain background in the set, which also looked like a silk moire (a fabric which she has successfully used in the past) really boosted the static presentation and made you want to step right into this candy pink corner, mixing and matching Calla's prints.

{"extracted_text":" 2015-05-15 Versus Calling Ah London. How Ive missed trampling up damp smelling staircases to get to concrete bunker roomswhere I get sploshed about with beer. Its back down to earth after my far-and-away otherworldly jaunts to Palm Springs and Cannes but with Donatella Versace leading the proceedings, it was never really going to be yer average event. Last night saw the first Versuscollection presented by Anthony Vaccarello, after his appointment as permanent creative director of the line, at a #VersusCalling event in London. When Versus was entrusted toDonatella by brother Gianni in the nineties, she was keen to kick things up a notch with by injectinga young and clubby spirit with party-slash-gig-slash-presentations.

{"extracted_text":" 06\/01\/2008 Mice on toast and watermelon juice T, Urban Outfitters. Skirt, vintage. Bag, Balenciaga. Heels, Jeffrey Campbell. Okay by this time I was getting sick of everything I had packed. Really, really sick, or more specifically, impulse purchase vulnerable sick. So after dragging a tireless man friend around Robertson Blvd. (the day of the Chanel opening!) and becoming thoroughly depressed by the Givenchy and Chloe shoes and Chanel sunglasses I couldnt afford, I went into LF for some friendlier prices and bought these Jeffrey Campbell mummy-esque (in the wrapped zombie way) Proenza knockoffs. Do note that they are weirdly much cheaper at Nordstrom, Ive been had! Oh well. I like the army green enough to almost not be bitter. We found this pretty park in Culver City after excitedly parking nearby to go to the Museum of Jurassic Technology, only to find that it didnt open till 2. I suppose it was foolish to expect such an establishment to operate on a normal schedule, and we decided it was most likely run by vampires. We killed time in the park until it opened, daintily sipping watermelon juice and raspberry lemonade. But the wait was well worth it. Let me tell you, it was the oddest, most WTF-inducing experience Ive had in a while..everything from taxidermied rabbits to real mice corpses on toast (seriously) to an entire room dedicated to the fine art of cats cradle and microscopic artwork done in the eyes of needles, all in an eery almost pitch black environment. LA people need to grab their weirdest friends and check this out (and make sure to linger in the Soviet space dog gallery and tea room upstairs!). I told my friend that he should plan on taking all future first dates there to test their taxidermy stamina. He calmly responded that he had already planned on doing so. Note that this is what my hair looks like when I havent touched a hairbrush for three days, I of course managed to forget this extremely necessary device before driving up. Then I foolishly sprayed this weird salt spray in it, which only served to tangle even further. It took some serious muscles to brush it out when I got home, which was kind of a shame, since Im pretty sure I was forming my first authentic dreadlocks. A huge thank you to R the Friar for his immaculate hosting skills and teaching me the glory of Guitar Hero. I guess I need an X Box now.
