It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive. \xa0Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history. \xa0There are also monumental\xa0canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings. \xa0Art on the island of Gor\xe9e is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac! This was one of my best days spent in Dakar, Senegal. \xa0I could never forget this day.\nDAY 3: CHEZ\xa0SALIM - LAC\xa0ROSE\xa0&\xa0The\xa0Seed Project's Culture Night\nLac Rose, also known as the Pink Lake, was once a lake filled with fish. \xa0Later, the fish ended up disappearing one by one and the lake produced salt. \xa0With the position of the sun and also the salt, the lake can give off the same effect of pink lemonade (but not as delightful if you drink it). \xa0Men and women gather buckets and boats of salt and divide them into sections on the shore. \xa0Most of the salt is exported and used in cities that need salt for the ground, to disintegrate the ice on the sidewalks. \xa0We visited the nearby villages, sand dunes and\xa0the beach. \xa0This whole journey was brought to us by four wheelers and a tour guide. \xa0Crops of mint and turnips grew in between villages, with even a fresh water supply dug from the ground. \xa0After the festivities, we ate on the shores local restaurant and later attended culture night at The Seed Academy.\nDAY 4 & 5: \xa0THE SEED ACADEMY\xa0\nThe Seed Academy is a non profit organization that runs an academy for young boys and girls. \xa0They use basketball and education as their platform to prepare opportunities in Senegal. \xa0With both education and talent, kids are prone to opportunities outside\xa0of Africa with scholarships and many more benefits. \xa0The days spent with the Seed Academy were amazing. \xa0The kids had been working hard and playing against each other all season in basketball games called the Hoop Forum. \xa0For lunch that day, we had a traditional Senegalese meal with local drinks of ginger, chicken and saut\xe9ed onion, and rice. \xa0The\xa0last day held the final game at the Marius Ndiaye Stadium. \xa0East won vs. West as NBA players Wilson Chandler of the Denver Nuggets\xa0and Gorgui Dieng of the Minnesota Timberwolves helped coach both sides. \xa0The Seed Academy showed so much love and were great hosts during my stay in Senegal. \xa0This isn't a farewell message, 'cause I'll be back!\n"}
