It also reflects the slaves that did not make it onto the boat due to illness, in which they were thrown out into the water, where they couldn't survive. \u00a0Today it is a landmark and one of the most talked about places in your school history books when referring to this time in history. \u00a0There are also monumental\u00a0canons around the island in which we met a few men selling their sculptures and paintings. \u00a0Art on the island of Gor\u00e9e is everywhere, and just like America, they absolutely love Tupac!

Added to that are kitty ears, a bell around my neck which I pulled off a studded collar and put onto a leather choker, fingerless faux leather studded gloves and of course no Bad Kitty is completed without a pink and black whip. I of course did a terrible job at remember to take pics before the party and sweaty post dancing makeup madness. But here's a little something. I'll do better next time, PROMISE!\nCurrently Coveting\n"},

Although I'm a fairly smiley person black makes me feel so TOUGH, haha! This jacket you're likely to see a lot. This asymetrical blazer styled jacket (leather front and jersey/sweatshirt material in the back) is sooooo easy to wear. I can throw it over anything and will. My harem styled jeans and hankercheif hem tank complete the outfit.\nHonestly I cannot remember where I got the tank but the Jacket came from a random boutique in NYC and the jeans in LA - I know, sorry. Shades, Dolce Gabana, sandals Steve Madden.\nCurrently Coveting\n"}]
